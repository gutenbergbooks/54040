<p class='pindent'>Gentle Reader, we are lunatic!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nay, do not be startled! Because we use the pronoun
<span class='it'>we</span>, we do not mean to pronounce <span class='it'>you</span> insane.
<span class='it'>We</span> is of the first person, and we would be the last
person to venture a doubt of your perfect sanity. It
would be libellous to do so, and we abhor lawsuits—in
which we have other than a professional interest.
We use a plural pronoun, but only because
it is more fashionable and dignified so to do. We
intend thereby to make a singular announcement
merely. Therefore, don’t think it strange. Be not
surprised, or yet offended. Nobody but <span class='it'>ourself</span> is
included in the declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us explain further. We fear lest we be misunderstood.
We pray, therefore, do not imagine
these presents to be a round-robin, signed by the
denizens of Bedlam. Neither, being disabused of
this notion, will you, if we are to be believed, count
us as crazy, because we avow ourself to be lunatic.
We are (saving the grammar, and the hastily expressed
opinion of an irritable maiden aunt,) <span class='it'>compos
mentis</span>. We wish not further to break down the
old rule of the Common Law, that no man shall be
permitted by his own plea to stultify himself. Of
course, if we should be indicted for murder to-morrow,
however innocent we might be of the
charge, we should acknowledge the homicide, and
plead insanity, monomania, or at any rate somnambulism,
but only for the reasons that we should wish
to be certain of an acquittal, and that we dread to do
any thing which might subject us to the charge of
eccentricity, and a departure from well established
usages. But under ordinary circumstances we should
resent the issuing of a commission <span class='it'>de lunatico inquiriendo</span>,
as tetchily as the summoning of a coroner’s
jury in our particular behalf. We sign our
contracts without the intervention or advice of an
overseer, and we should be vehemently opposed to
a rule of the Court of Probate appointing a conservator
over us. Neither Dr. Bell, nor yet Dr. Woodward,
has ever had us under his especial charge—our
head was never shaven but once, and then we were
out of it, to be sure, hard sick with the yellow fever
at Havana. Our waistcoats are crooked and curved
as becometh our shape and the fashion, are conveniently
provided with arm-holes, and the material,
generally, is buff cashmere or white Marseilles.
We possess a four-bladed pen-knife, given to us by a
member of Congress, just before election, as a token
of esteem, and this we usually carry in our trowsers
pocket and use unrestrictedly and without offense,
albeit the same has a whittling blade and we are
Yankee bred. We have on our dressing-table two
pairs of excellent Sheffield razors, and shave therewith
daily, as a gentleman should; and it is upon
these occasions only that we make mouths and
grimaces at ourself in the glass, or rave and stump.
We sleep in the third story, but the windows of our
dormitory are not grated or barred, and are often left
open o’nights. We need not tell our landlady when
we intend a sudden and brief absence, lest, perchance,
before our return, the ponds be dredged for our body,
our drawers searched for lost dying letters and commissions,
incoherently written, or that the newspapers
record a mysterious disappearance, and insert,
on our behalf, a premature obituary notice, illustrated
by misquotations from Shakspeare and the Scriptures.
We have never supposed ourself to be the
inventor of perpetual motion, or of a practically useful
rotary steam-engine. We lay no claim to the
British crown; do not confound our identity with that
of King David, or Lord Wellington, or Napoleon Bonaparte,
uncle or nephew; have no particular <span class='it'>penchant</span>
for red chalk, beads, belts, bits of looking-glass,
scrap-tin, or feathers; never adorn ourselves
with wreaths of straw, and are caught <span class='it'>sans culotte</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
only when having been out late over night, our privacy,
to our unspeakable confusion, is suddenly
invaded by the unconscious chamber-maid, as we
are leisurely dressing for a late breakfast, and sadly
ruminating on the folly of protracted festivities and
the mutability of the temper of landladies—our friends
don’t expect us to whoop at the table, and if, perchance,
we handle the carving-knife, they exhibit no
more of nervous agitation and alarm, than is the natural
result, under the circumstances, of a well-grounded
opinion that gravy shows better on platters than on
plaits. Indeed, we have never had any provocation
to go crazy—we never inherited any thing, not even
an eccentric tendency. We have never lost a fortune
for the best of all reasons. We have never
been concerned in land or city lot speculations. We
have never drawn a prize in a lottery; have never
had an attack of the <span class='it'>delirium tremens</span>, nor have we
been crossed in hopeless love. We have neither
much learning or great care; have never had a <span class='it'>coup
de soleil</span>, or a blow on the head, or a brain fever.
Our caput is sound as a nut, thank God; and thick
withal, as becomes a respectable citizen and burgess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fine, we are not mad, most gentle reader, in
any sense of the term; on the contrary, with all
modesty, we fully believe ourself to be a very sane,
very good-natured, very staid, very commonplace,
most inveterate old bachelor, sleeping nightly on the
third floor, and dining daily at the public table of a
very quiet inn, as we before hinted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, that the moon exercises an influence over
our imagination, we cannot deny; and this, saith
that learned lexicographer, Dr. John Walker, it is to
be lunatic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some people in and of the world, so
stolid, so matter-of-fact, so very commonplace, so
unimaginative, so void of all sense of the beautiful,
so much of the earth, earthy, as to look upon the
moon—nay, though—as never to look upon the moon,
except by accident, or to judge of the prospect of the
weather—as to consider the moon then, to amend
our phrase, only as the earth’s satellite, a lesser
light, a mere useful appendage to our mundane
sphere, made only to regulate the time of high water
at Greenwich, to save the corporation too great expense
for gas, and to obviate a larger consumption of
oil in lanterns and carriage-lamps; in fine, a thing
of mere Paine-ful necessity. Such people value the
heavenly bodies as children do pennies, according
to their relative brightness; and so, in comparison
with the sun, estimate the moon lightly, and the
stars as of small account. They are more unsusceptible
to gentle influences than the brutes.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader, it may be that you are lunatic yourself!
Most fervently hoping that this be so—in fine,
taking it for granted—our presumption, for an obvious
reason, grows apace—we shall seek to hold communion
with you of the moon. Not, however,
touching on those tedious topics which engage the
attention of mere astronomers and philosophers.
We leave the pursuit of such shadows to the shade
of Sir William Herschel, now probably resident on
its private estate in Uranus, to Professor Nichols,
and to Tom Dick, and—that is to say, to that man
of big figures and small means, the Rev. Thomas
Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And wherefore not? Who but these musty ones
cares to know that the moon revolves around the
earth once in every twenty-eight days, and so many
odd hours and minutes. Satisfied are we to expect
her coming each fourth week, and to count the
hours and minutes of secondary importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, gentle reader, on some delicious summer night,
when the full moon is shining down upon the smiling
earth, flooding it with glorious light, gilding the
crests of the lake waves, silvering the leaves of the
forest, casting a varying, many-colored mantle, sown
with pearls, over the fields of waving grain, nodding,
rustling, whispering to the coquettish zephyr
like a group of silk-clad dames, if, “on such a night
as this,” you care to remember that the fleecy clouds
the moon seems to kiss, are nearer to you by some
239,999 miles, why, then, you are no lunatic, and
not the man or woman we took you to be. Pray read
no further; you are too wise to waste time on such
nonsense. Light your greasy solar lamp. Shut your
blinds. Draw your curtains. Take down some
useful book, and compose yourself for a nap. Light
reading, especially of moonlight, is not your vocation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These stupid <span class='it'>savans</span> have broached some queer
theories about our favorite, though, dear reader. <span class='it'>Our</span>
favorite, we say, for we know that by this time we
have shaken ourselves rid of all people who remain
sensible of a moonlight night. They—the philosophers,
or some of them—malign her terribly—they
abuse her. Like old-fashioned doctors, in a case of
fever, they sturdily refuse to allow her a drop of
water; and cruel as Surajah Dowlah, to the English
prisoners at Calcutta, assign her a place void of an
atmosphere. Truly an arid conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can it be that, like a leaky cistern, the moon holds
no water? Let us consider a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this be true, then certainly there can be no sea-views
or sea-bathing in the moon. No cataracts, no
cascades, no mineral springs. Of course, no watering-places
and summer hotels. Flirtations are, of necessity,
scarce, we must suppose; especially when
we consider that the moon itself has no moon; that
midshipmen are found only in <a id='mari'></a>maritime states, and
that a fascinating foreigner must always come from
beyond a sea. Runaway matches are things of rare
occurrence, and there must be fewer provocations to
matrimony generally than in this world. Old maids
must, of course, be plentiful, though they can have
no tears to shed over disappointed hopes. There
may come a time when there will be only <span class='it'>the</span> Man
in the Moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turtles and soft-shelled crabs, oysters and canvas-back
ducks cannot thrive in such a place. The race of
aldermen must be extinct; and yet these same wiseacres
of astronomers claim to have discovered cities
in the moon! Cities without aldermen or oyster-saloons!
What absurdity!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
But, then, if this theory be correct, the country
cannot be cursed with cotton manufactories, steam-engines,
or foundries. The agitation of the tariff
question must be dry business. The climate cannot
be adapted to slave labor. The Lunars must be
democrats to a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drive, we presume, in open carriages. Umbrellas,
over-shoes, bathing-tubs, wash-hand-basins,
teapots, mops, lather-brushes, squirt-guns, and a
variety of such matters, too numerous to mention,
familiar and useful to us of the earth, are never
enumerated in the catalogue of a Lunarian auctioneer.
The ladies never clean house there. New
coats and dazzling beavers are safe from the pelting
of the pitiless shower, rained down from third-story
windows by awkward Irish girls. How do they
mix their grog? They take their spirits neat, we
presume, the only neat thing they can take—fourth
proof, every drop; and this is probably the origin of
the term, <span class='it'>taking a lunar</span>, to which seamen are so
much addicted. Fever-and-ague must be unknown
in the moon. Dropsy an unheard of disease. Drowning
a casualty never recorded in the bills of mortality.
Damp sheets are things not to be dreaded;
and so with a thousand ills with which water floods
us of the earth. Skating cannot be a fashionable
amusement, and natatory exercises, such as are
practiced at Cape May, would, we presume, be unutterably
shocking to the withered old maids of the
chaste planet. Moreover, Priesnitz must regard
the moon as a place singularly unwholesome, and
yet quite unfit for the establishment of a hydropathic
hospital, and it must present a most unpromising field
of labor to the American Baptist Board of Foreign
Missions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Howbeit, we don’t believe all that we hear of
the want of water in the moon. Tender-hearted
reader, dry your eyes; we are confident that we
used to hear our grandfather talk of a wet moon.
To his opinion we seriously incline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whether the moon be a desert or an ocean,
what care we? When she shines the dew falls on
us. Let that suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what if there be no air around the moon?
The Lunars breathe pure ether, then—and so do we,
“of a shiny night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inasmuch as our affection is for, and our subject
is the moon itself, we shall have little to say of the
inhabitants thereof. For all that we know they are
a dirty set, as the philosophers would fain make us
believe. Perhaps there may be none to speak of.
In the ancient legends of Mother Goose, it is recorded,
that the Man in the Moon (as if there were
but one) made a descent upon the earth, about meridian
one day. The hour would seem to indicate
that his residence in the planet is for somewhat the
same purpose as that which induces the presence of
a light-house keeper at his lonely post. He comes
down at noon, undoubtedly, as being the most convenient
season, for at night he could not well be
spared. Having spent the morning in preparing for
his nightly illumination, and entertaining a laudable
desire for earthly geographical information, he seizes
this opportunity to visit this world, and forthwith
inquires his most direct route to Norwich. We
wonder which route was recommended to him—whether
by the way of Hartford and the Willimantic
Railroad, by steamboat direct, or by Jersey Island
Railroad and Greenport Ferry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why it should have been a coincidence so remarkable
as to be worthy of record on the pages of
history, that a gentleman in Australia, on this day,
scalded his mouth with a “hasty plate” of brose of
moderate temperature, we have never been able to
divine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sun has thrown more light upon the moon,
and the theory of its being inhabited, than any other
luminary. The sun, we say—but not the real sun,
nor the True Sun, but the sun which “shines for
all”—The New York Sun—the Sun of Moses Y.
Beach—and Son. In certain numbers of that useful
newspaper, of the volume of 1834, if we recollect
aright, we shall find that Mr. Locke has given us
the key to many things which before were mysteries.
The good people of that time, when they read the
narrative of the extraordinary discoveries of Sir
John Herschel and his learned companions, at the
Cape of Good Hope, became firmly convinced that
the Man in the Moon was no fabulous personage;
but that he really existed, and a good many more of
the same sort with him, to say nothing of women,
children, and quadrupeds—all intelligent creatures,
knowing more than the Man in the Moon was generally
and proverbially supposed to know; students,
probably—for each creature had a shade over his
or her eyes, but one of Nature’s providing, showing
that the moon is not, probably, a good market for
green silk and pasteboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And speaking of green silk, in this connection, reminds
us of green cheese. But, psha! <span class='it'>that</span> idea is
exploded. If we proceed in this strain, noticing and
commenting upon every wild vagary of those romancing
fellows, the astronomers, somebody may
accuse us of wishing to make light of the moon,
the which is the furthest thing on earth from our
intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Didst ever read Locke’s Moon Hoax? We were
a school-boy at Albany when it was first published,
and we recollect well how gravely the old master
of a certain school in North Pearl street—the boys
used to call him the Centre of Gravity—announced
his full belief in its authenticity, and advised the
class in Algebra to look over the calculations. And
how an old lady of our acquaintance wrote an article
on the wonders of modern science, and the probabilities
of a railroad to the moon in the course of a
generation or two, which the editor of the Evening
Journal wouldn’t publish; whereat the old lady denounced
him to us savagely. We have never been
able ever since to think of Mr. Weed, except as a
man radically opposed to internal improvements—externally
projected. What a demand there was for
telescopes and Extra Suns! What crowds of people
there were for two or three nights on Capitol Hill,
gaping at the full moon, as if they expected to
discover one of Mr. Locke’s hooded sheep grazing
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
on the rays which shot from her broad, round
disc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one theory of these wise ones that seems
to concern us mundane fellows a little more nearly.
It is said that the moon, owing to her less size and
small distance from the earth, has but little comparative
attractive power, and that a body projected
but a short distance from the surface of the moon
would stand as fair a chance for a sublunary fall, as
for a return to its original sphere. And now we recollect,
in this place, that although we have a well
authenticated account of the Man in the Moon’s
coming down to the earth, there is no record of his
return. Perhaps the Lunars have a motto—<span class='it'>Facilis
descensis Terrae, etc.</span> The adventurer aforesaid
may be carrying on the chandlery business in Norwich
this day, or perhaps traveling in company with
the Wandering Jew, seeking for “the jumping-off
place.” Who knows but that all the moon-faced
people we encounter are descendants of this great
descender. Or, dear brother lunatic, it may be that
<span class='it'>we</span> may claim a celestial ancestry in his person, and
that the idiosyncrasy which distinguishes us from
common mortals, is the result of an instinctive
longing for the bright former home of our common
progenitor. But to return; despite the facility with
which, as this theory seems to indicate, our foreign
relations may come to us on a lasting visit, this notion
of the looseness and levity of matters and things
on the moon’s surface is unpleasantly suggestive.
We remember ugly stories of big, odd-looking stones,
found newly half-buried in the ground, the origin of
which folks formerly ascribed to meteors, and such
like flash gentry, and latterly to our favorite. While
lying on one’s back in a cool arbor, apostrophizing
the Queen of Night, one does not like to feel the
least uneasiness, lest she, by way of reply, pitch
half a ton of granite through the frail, vine-covered
roof. We always had a notion that the blessed St.
Stephen died a very horrid death. The fable of the
Boys and the Frogs has always excited our warmest
sympathies for the unoffending and persecuted reptiles.
We have pitied even the merited fate of the
Giant of Gath. Besides, a general belief in this
theory would not be apt to cause an increase in the
number of green-houses and sky-lights; and a cousin
of ours, a very worthy young woman, has just
married a glazier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A true lunatic, as we have hinted, is not content
with thinking of the moon as a mere planet, convenient
for the light it sheds, and the facilities it
affords to sailors in finding their longitude. He wishes
to personify, to deify; to speak to her, to think of
her as a sentient being, celestial, divine, to be sure,
but with a human heart; rejoicing, sorrowing with
the mortals she looks down upon. Will any blockhead
prate of the unreasonableness of such unphilosophical
wishes? Has not the moon a face, eyes,
nose, mouth, clothed with unearthly beauty, like and
yet unlike that of the Sphinx? How many generations
of men like us have gazed upon those calm,
changeless features! That cold, chaste, pitying face
returned the wondering stare of Adam and Eve
their first night in Eden. It shone upon the lifeless
corpse of Abel. It looked sorrowfully down upon
the last night of the antediluvian world, and in its
next revolution saw itself everywhere reflected in
the waters that covered the whole earth. Its rays
have gilded the pinnacles which for ages have rested
beneath the stagnant, bitter waters of the Dead
Sea, and have trembled amidst the leaves and flowers
of the hanging gardens of Nineveh and Babylon.
The Chaldean shepherds used to gaze upon it as we
do now, and held therewith an intercourse, intimate,
mysterious, above our comprehension. It paled with
fear and dread when Troy burned. The white
temples of Athens, in the time of Pericles, glowed
in the light of that very moon, upon which we of
this later day may look at will. The streets of Rome
were made brilliant by the same moon which to-night
shines upon gas-lighted Broadway. It has
seen the Temple of Solomon and its magnificent
successor in all their glory. It saw England a
savage waste, Germany and Gaul ere Cæsar’s legions
were born. It knew and visited the wide extent of
the New World before the foundations of Genoa
were laid, but kept the secret safe. The moon saw
London a humble village on the banks of the unstoried
Thames; Paris, while yet the island in the
Seine, contained all the metropolis of France; New
York, no upstart in this connection, in the time of
the puissant Peter Stuyvesant. Her face has not
changed since the dear friend, over whose grave the
grass has grown these twenty years, looked last
upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun’s face is not familiar. Few are the times
we look steadily at it, and then it is disguised; the
memory of it is associated with smoked glass,
eclipses and strange phenomena. The stars, as individuals,
are too small, too much alike, for us to
feel acquainted with. But the moon—why, her face,
each feature of it, is as familiar as the face of our
dearest friend and next door neighbor; and as it
looks to us to-night, so have all mankind seen it
since the foundations of the earth were laid. It is
the same broad, pure, serene, changeless face;
always smiling the same thoughtful, pitying smile.
The world has changed beneath, but as she looked
to Adam, so looks the moon to us, this glorious
August night; and were the innumerable dead to
rise to-night, that face would be the sole familiar
object to greet the eyes of the astonished host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while we speak—this moment—how strange,
how diverse the scenes she looks down upon and
illuminates. As she slowly ascends our heavens,
the early rising Moslem in Hindostan sees her pale
face in the western sky, as in his morning devotions
he bows his head toward Mecca and the tomb of
his prophet. The western sides of the eternal
pyramids glow in her brilliant light, as they have
been wont to do for thousands of years. She is
riding above the heads of wild Arabs, traversing in
the cooler night, the sparkling, heated sands of the
Great Desert. The fountain springs of the Niger
and the Nile she spies out, and in them sees her
image. The jungles of unknown Ethiopia are illuminated
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
by her presence. The waves of the Mediterranean
sparkle in her light, as they dash against
the shores of Holy Palestine, of classic Greece, of
storied Italy, and of hoary, ancient Egypt. She looks
steadily down into the crater of Vesuvius. The ice-clad
summit of Mont Blanc stands ghost-like, and
catches first the silvery radiance of her beams. All
Europe lies in deep sleep and varied beauty beneath
her. All over the broad Atlantic the white sails
of a thousand ships are glittering in her rays. On
she comes, over Columbus’ track, and the New
World, from where Sir John Franklin lies imbedded
in northern ice to the stormy Horn, hails her coming—not
as but a few hundred years since. Now the
steeples of New York, Havana, and Rio catch the
silvery light. On, on she rides. In an hour the
Father of Waters will be glowing beneath her vertical
rays. A few hours more she will shine upon
the snow-tops of the Rocky Mountains, and the
western shores of our vast territory, and the eyes of
our distant, gold-seeking friends, and our bold seamen
on the wide Pacific, will be brightened by her
presence. And then she will bid us good-night, and
speed her way above the countless islands, coral-reefs,
and tranquil waters of that far spreading sea,
to spy out the secrets of jealous Japan and curious
China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having proved that the moon is a person, it becomes
important to ascertain its sex. Our minds
are made up on this point. The poets have always
spoken of her as a lady. But it is no more than fair
to notice some of the objections which have been
urged against the probability of this hypothesis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is well known that the fair sex, to a woman, are
admirers of the moon; and, as ladies generally are
not prone to speak in praise of beauties of their own
sex, it has been supposed, therefore, that she cannot
be of the feminine gender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This instance is, however, the exception to the
general rule, we suppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some ill-natured person has endeavored to explain
this fondness of ladies for the moon, by reminding
us of the popular notion that the moon has a man in
it. A most scandalous, malicious, and impertinent
suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an offset to the arguments adduced by those
who take the masculine side of the question, other
cynical, crusty old bachelors have cited the lines of
Addison—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Soon as the Evening’s shades prevail</p>
<p class='line0'>The Moon takes up the wondrous tale,</p>
<p class='line0'>And nightly to the listening Earth</p>
<p class='line0'>Repeats the story of her birth—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and ask triumphantly, who but a feminine could talk
all night, and every night, and never tire withal.
But as the context shows that all the stars and
planets, some of whom are indubitably of the sterner
sex, are alike infected with this <span class='it'>cacoethes loquendi</span>,
this seems not to settle the question, unless it be
satisfactorily shown, that only the males of the
planetary system are obliged to wait “their turn,”
to “confirm the tidings” spoken of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile we shall believe the poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon, then, is a lady, and a beauty. But
loveliness, to be appreciated, should bear the stamp
of rank. Many beautiful women grow up unadmired
and unsought, because their parentage is obscure,
and their station humble; while pert, vulgar
faces pass for handsome, only because their possessors
have also wealth and rank. A gilded frame
makes a good picture in the eyes of nearly all the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the moon is not only a beauty, but she is
somebody—one of the higher classes. She moves
in an elevated sphere; is of aristocratic, nay, of
royal blood. We have said enough. Each fair republican
reader is propitiated, and for the ears of
their fat papas we will whisper, “She is enormously
rich, ’tis said”—by the poets. These gentlemen,
whose imaginations, after all, are not one half so
lively as those of Wall-street brokers, will tell you
that the moon is all silver; that her rays are silver,
and that they silver every thing they rest upon.
However, this last assertion must not be construed
<a id='lite'></a>literally by people who cannot bear disappointment
very well. If some such sanguine person should
leave a bogus dollar in the moonlight over night,
expecting by these means to make it good coin and
legal tender, he would be chagrined in the morning,
unless somebody had been cheated into stealing the
base metal, to find it a bogus dollar still. A dead
gold-fish, exposed of a warm summer night to the
same influence, will be sadly “changed,” as the
housewifes express it, to be sure; but the transmutation
will not be from gold to silver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancestry and origin of the moon, though admitted
to be highly respectable, are not so well
known as some fastidious people might desire; and,
as is usual where there is some mystery and uncertainty,
there have been various and contradictory
stories told by the divers persons who have undertaken
to give us information on these points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moses tells us very briefly and positively, that she
is twin sister of the sun, and that her birth-day was
the 3d of January, in the year 0001. Since that time,
with the sun for a partner, she has been constantly
dancing attendance on the earth, ruling the night,
while her brother, like the Grand Vizier of Algiers,
has regulated the affairs of the Day. Once only have
the twain rested from their labors. At the request
of Joshua, who got somewhat belated in a skirmish
with the Five Kings, some years ago, the sun stood
still over Gibeon, while his sister reclined in the
valley of Ajalon and fanned herself. We cannot tell
certainly whether the moon has ever been able to
recover from this delay, and catch up to the place
in which she would have been if the detention had
not happened. But an ingenious and learned Hibernian
philosopher has very plausibly suggested, that
she is still behind her time, and that this is the reason
why she does not rise earlier of dark nights, for the
illumination of which she was so evidently intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Mosaic account of the moon’s origin and
early life is esteemed to be the more prosaic; and
the poets, who have taken great pains to look into
these matters, give greater credence to the Pagan
historians.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
She then, the heathens say, was the daughter of
Hyperion and Thea, and the sister of the sun and of
Aurora—not Aurora Borealis; she came of a northern
family, and is but distantly related. The moon, like
some other children we have heard of, was born of
one of her aunts; so that if she had been sent to
call her father to Thea, she could very properly have
addressed him as Uncle Hy. Her sister, Aurora,
it seems, was also her cousin-german, and with
equal propriety she might have called her brother,
“my dear sun,” or “Cousin Sol,” as the humor
seized her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon has ever been a favorite with lovers;
albeit she herself is a maiden averse to matrimony.
Like some dear, good old maids we wot of, she is
no hindrance to flirtations, never stands in the way
of love declarations, and has assisted at some runaway
matches. She smiles pleasantly on the extravagances
of enamored young people, winks at
their follies, and knows, but never tells their secrets.
We firmly believe that she has heard more than half
the solemn vows which lovers have uttered since
the world began, and has witnessed a large majority
of first kisses. Had it not been for the delicious attractive
power with which her rays are pregnant,
many are, and have been, the married pairs that
never would have been drawn together. Bashful
youths gather courage from moonlight. Cold natures
are fired by its subtle, latent heat. Proud hearts
are fused by it into one. Ascetic resolves melt in
the focus of the moon’s rays as easily as lead in a
poacher’s ladle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon has a peculiar fascination for dogs, too.
Her influence upon the canine race is no less potent
than that which she exercises over the feelings of
human lovers. All the world over</p>

<p class='noindent'>But for this we should have been a married gentleman
of large fortune. The moon and a Newfoundland
puppy did us an ill-turn once upon a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our early youth, while a sophomore at college,
we attended the obsequies of Euclid, for which devout
act, taken in connection with divers previous
doings, not pleasant to the Faculty, we received
sentence of suspension, and forthwith retired, like
Sir William Temple, into the country. Our retreat
was the residence of an extremely worthy and
learned, but somewhat prosy clergyman; who, having
been ousted from his pastoral charge of the discontented
souls in his parish, occupied his time and
gained a living by the culture of corn, potatoes, tame
oats and wild young gentlemen. Near by lived a
retired ship-chandler, happy in the possession of a
solid fortune, an ethereal daughter, a white villa and a
black Newfoundland dog. How well we remember
the lovely Matilda. She was very fair, with bright
brown hair that hung, every afternoon, in ringlets
over her neck and shoulders; her blue eyes were of
the color of the sky; her form was sylph-like; her
teeth were pearls; her lips were rubies; and—so
forth. Moreover, her age tallied with ours almost
exactly—that is to say, she was eighteen, and we a
quarter past; and her fortune, in expectation, was
three times as many thousands. We will not stop
now to relate how romantically we became acquainted
with this very lovely young person—how
extremely wet and grateful she was, and how exceedingly
muddy and gratified we were—how profuse
were her father’s thanks and perspiration, as
he met us at the garden-gate, after a severe run
down the gravel-walk; how urgent were his invitations
to make ourself at home in future at his
house—how we aided the lovely and very damp
Matilda to gain the door—how belligerent were the
manifestations of the Newfoundland dog, as we met
him on our return to the street; how charming the
gentle Matilda appeared the next morning; how
slowly, after that, we progressed in Greek, and how
rapidly in romantic experiences; how gracious was
the old gentleman; how excessively sly was his
wit—for that was before our father died insolvent,
to the great astonishment and chagrin of all his creditors,
and just as everybody else said they always
knew he would. All this has nothing to do with
the moon’s influence on the dog. The latter never
took kindly to us. Our appearance at our first interview
with him seemed to impress him unfavorably.
He always behaved as if he thought we had
usurped his prerogative, in rescuing his young mistress
from a muddy-watery grave. He eyed us
askance; he appeared to believe our gentlemanly
clothing a disguise over the damp and discolored
raiment which had invested our limbs at the time
we first encountered him, and manifested an evident
and almost irrepressible longing to strip us of
our assumed garb. In consequence of which he
was doomed to close confinement, every night, in a
kennel beneath the back piazza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fair Matilda was coquettish. Her father’s
evident preference for us was annoying. It was not
the rule as laid down in novels. She seemed willing
enough to love us, at times, but she did not like
to have the current of her true love run smooth.
Her father’s will was in the way, because it did not
cross the path between her and us. Still, the aquatic
exploit was <span class='it'>comme il faut</span>. Our reputation for wildness
and deviltry at college was agreeable. Our
dark locks, swarthy complexion, Byronic shirt collar
and scholastic disgrace were all but irresistible.
She could see we were desperately in love, and that
was the mischief. Her sweet consent could not be
gained. An acknowledgment of love, or a kiss,
could not be ravished from her pretty lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this conjuncture we invoked the Moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a most glorious August night. We sat in
the back piazza, a perfect heaven of a place, embowered
in a clump of locusts, and shaded by a wilderness
of vines and flowering shrubs. As far as the
eye could see, from between the whispering boughs,
extended the magnificent valley of the Connecticut,
stretching far away to the south; the course of the
beautiful river in its midst plainly marked, here by a
broad ribbon of glittering silver, and yonder by the
long, slender line of mist, through which the distant
landscape shone more heavenly and in softer light
than the smiling country all around, where fields and
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
villages, groves and steeples, straight highways and
meandering brooks showed us plainly in the rich
moonlight as if the noonday sun were shining. The
air was soft, and not too warm, heavily laden with
the perfume of flowers. From the village green,
ever an anon, rose and swelled faint, sweet strains
of music. The band was practicing for September
training. We always thought the bugle had something
to do with the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda reclined upon a sofa which had been
wheeled out from the parlor, and with her hand,
half buried in curls, supporting her head, her face
turned toward the light, and her white, graceful
figure disposed with careless ease—<span class='it'>and</span> strict propriety,
dear reader—upon the luxurious couch, she
seemed like a creature from another and a heavenly
world. The moon’s spell was upon her. We seized
the opportunity and her hand. With all the eloquence
of an ardent, eighteen-year-old sophomore
we told her that we loved her. We swore by the
bright moon above us—we vowed that cruel parents
and tremendous obstacles, existing only in imagination,
should never part us. We begged for one
sweet avowal of love, one word of hope. We raved
of suicide, and swore that her refusal should be a
sentence of death to us. Matilda was touched, her
hand trembled in ours, it sought but faintly to be
withdrawn. Her eyelids drooped, then raised, then
drooped again; her bosom heaved, her mouth quivered,
her lips began to frame one short, sweet, low-whispered
word—when Bruin—yes, that was the
accursed animal’s name—from his kennel just beneath
the place where we sat—but we can’t describe
the unearthly yell. All the damned spirits in Hades,
in full chorus, could never send from their hoarse
throats such an infernal sound as did that big, black
dog vomit forth upon the still night air, complaining
to the moon. The spell was broken. Matilda withdrew
her hand—laughed in our face, sprang to the
balustrade, laughed again and called “Bruin”—threw
the vile beast some cake—bade us good-night
and vanished; and the next morning she was more
distant, cold and provoking than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog died a few days afterward in strong convulsions—upon
which event Matilda conceived a
strong aversion to us, which continued until we
went back to college. The last we knew of her she
was married to an eminent hardware merchant, and
was the mother of two fine children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon exercises a strong and mysterious influence
upon other matters than lovers’ hearts and
dogs’ voices. ’Tis said she is more benevolently
inclined in her youthful weeks than when, having
grown round and full, she has passed the “turn of
life” and begins to wane. So, we have heard, it is
with other belles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a gallant ship has foundered at sea, with
hosts of brave hearts on board, not because she was</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Built i’ the eclipse and rigged with curses dark,”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>but for the sound reason that her rotten timbers and
unsound planks were cut in the moon’s waning
weeks. By the by, who ever saw a ship that was
not rigged with curses, and navigated, too, for that
matter? What is there about salt water that predisposes
one to swear so? No wonder that the sea
is “deep blue!” If all the oaths that sailors ever
swore fell overboard, the ocean must be fourth proof
“liquid d—nation” by this time! Rum is dove’s
milk in comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No farmer of the old school plants his corn, cuts
his hay, or, especially, kills his pork in the moon’s
wane. Therefore swine in his pen are safe for a
fortnight after “the full o’ the moon,” lest, perchance,
when the summer heats shall have come
again, and six stout, hungry “men folks” assemble
round his board, waiting with moist brows and
watering lips, impatient for the wonted unctuous
noon-day meal, the mighty slab of “strange flesh”
which, erewhile, was with difficulty forced into the
capacious pot, be found, upon the raising of the lid,
shrunken, withered, boiled away, curtailed of its
fair proportions; all that remains a little “nub,”
scarce half enough for one of the voracious, disappointed
crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At such a time, sore is the mortification of the
farmer’s buxom wife. Thrifty she means to be, but
never stingy. She blusheth as she deposits on the
table a huge pewter platter, covered, apparently,
with naught but turnips, potatoes and other “garden
sauce.” She answereth deprecatingly to her husband’s
wondering inquiry, if she has “forgotten the
pork.” Forgotten it! no! nor ever will! The
ghost of the vanished meat now stareth her in the
face! Fork in hand, she wipeth her flushed brow
with her plump, bare arm, and pointeth to the pile
of smoking potatoes, beneath which is buried the
shrivelled abortion of a meal. She telleth, while
her husband makes a Barmecidical show of carving
the bit, how that “pork killed in the old o’ the
moon is sure to shrink in the pot.” She glanceth
furtively around the board, to see whether any
churlish or waggish hind smiles skeptically or
disdainfully, or winketh at his neighbor. She
calleth hastily to Jane to bring the cider-pitcher,
forgotten in the trouble, and hurrieth away to the
kitchen to pack up an unusually munificent and
toothsome afternoon’s luncheon. There we leave
her, and invoke in her behalf the sympathy of Mr.
Gliddon. Who so well as he knoweth the embarrassments
and disappointments which sometimes
follow the taking off the cover?</p>

<p class='pindent'>An inexperienced housewife, sometimes, will, for
once, adventure upon soap-making “in the old of
the moon.” Albeit such an attempt is but an unavailing
expenditure of grease and patience. The incredulous
tyro is forced to remember sadly the precepts,
<span class='it'>receipts</span>, and warnings of her wiser and less
philosophical mother. She repenteth her folly in
apron of tow-cloth and ashes. Satan seemeth, indeed,
to be the father of all lyes. Death is in the
potash. The carefully preserved contents of the
soap-grease barrel disdain an alliance with such bedevilled
trash. The potash, in its turn, has lost
its Russian-like appetite for grease, and turns up its
nose at the odorous drippings and unctuous pot-scum.
The vexed young matron mingles her sweat
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
and tears with the boiling, steaming, ill savored, ill
assorted mass, which does, indeed, seem to “bubble,
bubble, toil and trouble,” in a bewitched caldron.
All is in vain. Crying wont help it. Coaxing wont
do. Stirring is unavailable. For once agitation is
ineffectual. Invocation is useless. The soft soap
wont come. Human nature gives way. The compost
heap receives the ingredients which were intended
for the soap barrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader, didst ever go on a sleigh-ride in the
full of the January moon? We speak not now of
one of your city rides, half the way over almost
naked pavements, to some suburban hotel—but a
regular-built, old-fashioned country sleigh-ride, with
a supper and ball at the end of it. No? Can we
depict such a scene to you? With many doubts and
fears we undertake the work—a pleasant task if it
can be well accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine then, a small, New England, country village;
one of those that are formed by a cluster of
white houses about a shaded square, and rows of
similar dwellings on each side of a long, wide street,
lined with elms and buttonwoods. The time is
seven o’clock; the round full moon has risen above
the distant eastern hills—all over the square, and
adown the broad street stretches an expanse of dazzling
snow. The sleigh paths are yet almost as
purely white as the untrodden snow on either side.
Save <a id='where'></a>where the steel-shod runners have left gleaming
stripes, and the shadows of the snow banks fall, these
tracks are hardly distinguishable. The deep snow
fell only last night, and the roofs of the houses, the
fences, and the dark fir trees in the front-door yards
are yet covered with heavy, glittering, sparkling
burdens. The houses on the east side cast long
shadows across the street. Those on the other
side glow in the moonbeams only less white than the
snow itself. Columns of pale, gray smoke ascend
from every chimney, straight and steadily, until they
mingle with the dark blue sky. One chimney alone
emits a rushing crowd of fiery sparks; and all around
the low, wide portal of the rude shed it overtops, a
ruddy gleam shines out upon troops of men and
startled horses, and casts a fierce glare upon the
trampled snow around. Then the cheerful ring of
hammer and anvil is heard. The sturdy smiths
work half the night at such a time, for smooth-shod
horses are not the nags for a sleigh ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the village houses lights are rapidly flitting from
chamber to chamber, and if we pass along the side
paths we shall hear gay laughs, and merry screams,
and the sounds of hurried preparation. At each door
stands a gayly adorned sleigh, a perfect nest of bear-skins
and buffalo-robes. The impatient horses stamp
and chafe, and the merry sound of sleigh-bells chimes
in with the ring of the blacksmith’s anvil. Around
the piazzas of the hotel a crowd of the villagers is
assembled. The boys and loafers are in a state of
extreme excitement. Hark! A whoop—a hurrah
from the stable-yard in the rear!—a sharp, clear
crack of a whip! Hi! hi! Then a plunging and
trampling. Another hurrah, and a fierce jangling of
a hundred varied toned bells! Around the corner it
comes! The boys and loafers shout again—six
horses, rearing, pitching, plunging, rush with a wide
sweep from out the lane, dragging after them a huge,
open, omnibus sleigh. As the great ark ranges in
front of the hotel, and its mad team subsides into
comparative quiet, forth issue from the thronged
piazzas crowds of village belles and beaux. Can it
be that so many may find room aboard the sleigh,
capacious as it is? Leave that to the Genius who
presides over expeditions of this sort. In a sleigh,
large or small, there is always room for one more.
In the meantime the doors of the private dwellings
have been opened, and from each emerges a beshawled,
bemuffed, behooded, and overshod damsel—or
two or three perhaps. Their happy beaux, clad
in overcoats of pilot-cloth, in seal-skin caps, red
worsted leggings, and buckskin gloves, escort them
to the sleighs. The procession is formed in front of
the hotel. Twenty sleighs, besides the teeming omnibus.
The last in the line is a crockery crate,
mounted upon a rude pair of runners and hitched behind
a tandem team. The leader is a three-year old
colt, wild and but half broken, and now, crazy with
the noise, he is kicking and plunging like mad. In
the crate stands the dare-devil of the village; a rich,
handsome, graceless, good-natured scamp—the darling
of the girls, the marvel of the boys, the terror of
the piously disposed, and the favorite of all. He
prefers to ride alone. Now all is ready—the band
strikes up—the driver of the omnibus stands erect
and tightens his reins—crack, goes the long whiplash—the
horses plunge and start, the snow creaks,
the bells jingle, the boys and loafers hurrah, the
beaux laugh as the girls scream, and away flies the
long caravan, like an express train, down the broad
street, thundering, cracking, screaming, laughing.
They turn the corner, all but the daredevil and his
crockery crate, <span class='it'>they</span> are upset in a snow-drift, but
before the army of boys and loafers can reach the
scene of the mishap, all is right side up again, and
the last seen of dare-devil he is driving by the whole
train, his frantic leader touching the snow only once
in a rod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours afterward six reeking horses drag the
omnibus up to the hotel piazzas again—a string of
sleighs come in behind—one by one the stragglers
arrive. Dare-devil and his team are among the missing,
and on inquiry are reported as seen last, the one
kissing the landlady at a tavern ten miles away, and
the other engrossing the attention, and calling into
active exercise all the strength and agility of the
landlord and his negro hostler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime twenty miles of snow path have
been scoured over by the merry, frost-covered throng
disembarking on the steps. Thousands of merry
speeches have been said—a whole jest-book full of
funny stories have been told. Every pretty hand in
the company has been squeezed. Every pretty cheek
has been kissed, and, we doubt not, almost every
pretty lip. At least nine flirtations have been commenced.
The moon has drawn together three pairs
of twin hearts, and set them throbbing in unison—and
one little question has been put and answered,
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
very satisfactorily to the absorbed couple in yonder
sleigh, which is arriving late, closely pursued by the
shouting dare-devil and his prancing team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night the glaring windows of the ball-room
shake and rattle. The inspiring music, to which
they keep time, the sound of the dancers’ feet, the
merry ringing of lamps, and the buzz of conversation
are heard by the sleepy watchers in the bar-room
below, who while away the hours, except when disturbed
by eruptions of the beaux from above, in quest
of confectionary and lemonade, or perhaps stronger
beverages, by playing checkers, drinking flip, smoking
cigars, and endlessly discussing the points and
merits of divers horses of the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pale moon lights home the revelers, just in
time to save her sister Aurora the trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young May moon has been justly celebrated
by the poets, and many have supposed, that at this
season the hearts of lovers are more susceptible than
at any other time. Truly the moonlight of May is
very beautiful and love inspiring—but the August
and September moon is the time of times—when the
air is clear and warm, without cloud or chill, and
rich and faint with the odors of the ripe fruits—when
the corn and grain and all that grows from the earth’s
bosom are at full height and verging toward maturity—when
other leaves than those of tall trees rustle
in the night wind—when the katy-did and cricket
hold cheerful conversation, and fill the air with
noisy clamor, near akin to silence—when the nights
have grown longer and cooler than in the fierce mid-summer—when
the moon seems larger and fuller
than its wont, and its light has a deeper tone—then
is the time to enjoy, in perfection, moonlight nights
and lunatic fancies. Nights we say—not evenings.
In the evenings one sees company and receives calls,
takes wearying walks, hears commonplace remarks
about the beauty of the weather and the prospects of
the crops, eats ice-creams, drinks sherry-cobblers,
or, it may be, smokes cigars and reads the evening
newspaper. It is a border ground, upon which the
people of the work-day world make forays. But
“the small hours,” far in “the stilly night,” from
twelve to three, contain the true romance of moonlight.
The dull world is asleep, there is a new heaven
and a new earth, peopled only by fairies, lunatics,
ghosts and poets. Bright heavenly hours! Methinks
in praise of them we could “mark out a measure of
verse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Give to us, then, the moonlit nights of fragrant
August and mature September. There is a body to
them, a delicate aroma withal—the intoxication is
heavenly, such as nectar might produce. Then it is
that heaven seems descended to the earth, and fairy
land restored. Then it is, that, if we find ourselves
alone with one of the other sex, by the soft light, we
are prone to imagine her to be our better self, our
other moiety, the twin soul for which we have
longed in our dreams, and—hence the propriety of a
proper selection of moonlight company, judiciously
made, before sunset. Then it is that we like to talk
but little, and only in whispers and low tones. Then
it is that our souls grow large, and we cannot believe
ourselves mortal. Deep ardent longings seize
us for something we know not what. Tears, neither
of sadness or joy, spring to our eyes. Delicious, incomprehensible
emotions agitate our hearts. Strange
things seem easy of credence, and to see a troop of
fairies dancing on the green lawn, or the placid ghost
of a dear friend, half hidden in the shade of yonder
vine, would startle us but little, and would seem all
in keeping. Then we grow poetical—romantic—at
peace with all the world—then chilly—then—ah!
poor human nature!—then sleepy! and when, six
hours after, we rise, at the third call, to a late cold
breakfast, eggs, rolls and coffee seem to us of great
importance, and occupy the whole attention of a

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader—while we write the pale, exhausted
moon is setting behind the distant ridge of Talcott
mountain. The tall tower of Montevideo stands like
a lonely, belated giant, in full relief against the silver-gray
western sky. Our hair is damp with dew—our
numb and weary fingers can hardly retain the
blunt pencil with which we have indited the preceding
extravagances. There is a faint, ruddy glow
in the east—we hear the neigh of Aurora’s steeds.
Good night then, dear, lunatic reader. May the
morn find you sane—the night mad again—and long
may it be ere the soft light of the full moon shall rest
upon the green sod of your grave, and glow, reflected
from the marble of your monument.</p>

<p class='line'>Beautiful girl, I have wandered far,</p>
<p class='line'>Toward the rising sun and the evening star,</p>
<p class='line'>I have roamed ’mid the Northern wastes of snow,</p>
<p class='line'>And strayed <a id='where2'></a>where the soft magnolias blow,</p>
<p class='line'>But I never gazed on a face as bright</p>
<p class='line'>As thine, sweet spirit of young delight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Beautiful girl, thou art bright and fair</p>
<p class='line'>As an angel-shape in the moonlight air,</p>
<p class='line'>No shadow rests on thy brow of snow</p>
<p class='line'>Save that of thy tresses drooping low,</p>
<p class='line'>Love’s own dear light is wandering oft</p>
<p class='line'>O’er thy gentle lip of carmine soft,</p>
<p class='line'>Thy lovely cheek, where the rich, red glow</p>
<p class='line'>Of the warm blood melts through the virgin snow,</p>
<p class='line'>Is sweetly blending in one rich dye</p>
<p class='line'>The woven beauties of earth and sky;</p>
<p class='line'>Truth, holy truth in its freshness dwells</p>
<p class='line'>Deep, deep in thy dark eyes’ shaded wells,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Beautiful girl, I have seen thee move</p>
<p class='line'>A floating creature of joy and love,</p>
<p class='line'>As light as a mist on the sunrise gale,</p>
<p class='line'>Or the buoyant sway of a bridal veil,</p>
<p class='line'>Till I almost looked to see thee rise</p>
<p class='line'>Like a soaring thought to the free blue skies,</p>
<p class='line'>Or melt away in the thin blue air,</p>
<p class='line'>Like a vision of fancy painted there.</p>
<p class='line'>Thy low sweet voice, as it thrills around,</p>
<p class='line'>Seems less a sound than a dream of sound;</p>
<p class='line'>Softly and wildly its clear notes swell</p>
<p class='line'>Like the spirit-tones of a silver bell,</p>
<p class='line'>And the lips whence the fairy music flows</p>
<p class='line'>Is to fancy’s eye like a speaking rose.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Beautiful, beautiful girl, thou art</p>
<p class='line'>A vision of joy to the throbbing heart,</p>
<p class='line'>A star sent down from a world of bliss</p>

<p class='line'>A rainbow pictured by love’s own sun</p>
<p class='line'>On the clouds of being, beautiful one.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Beautiful girl, ’tis a weary year</p>
<p class='line'>Since thy sweet voice fell on my ravished ear.</p>
<p class='line'>’Tis a long, long year of light and gloom</p>
<p class='line'>Since I gazed on thy young cheek’s lovely bloom—</p>
<p class='line'>Yet thy gentle tones of music still</p>
<p class='line'>Through the holiest depths of memory thrill</p>
<p class='line'>Like tones of a fount, or breeze, or bird,</p>
<p class='line'>In the long gone years of childhood heard.</p>
<p class='line'>And oft in my dark and lonely moods,</p>
<p class='line'>When a demon-wing o’er my spirit broods,</p>
<p class='line'>Thine image seems on my soul to break</p>
<p class='line'>Like the sweet young moon o’er a gloomy lake,</p>
<p class='line'>Filling its depths as the shadows flee,</p>
<p class='line'>With beauty and love and melody.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR THE CROWN OF JEWELS.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY ANGELE DE V. HULL.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>(<span class='it'>Concluded from page 304.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord bless us, my children! what a noise,” cried
Mr. de la Croix on the morrow as he entered the
store-room. “I am deaf! give me some claret and
water some of you! I am thirsty enough to swallow
bottle and all. I have had lamps fastened to every
other tree in the avenue and every column around
the piazza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie brought him the iced wine and ran off to
work again. She was beating eggs for a mayonnaise,
and directing the servant behind her in chopping
celery and chicken for salad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lisa was standing on a table pouring from an immense
bowl a stream of icing over a pyramid of
cake that stood in a salver on the floor. Rose was
frothing eggs for something else, Kate was churning
syllabub, and Blanche was pounding almonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. de la Croix stopped his ears and called out as
loudly as he could, “Halt! order! I want to talk.
Where are those great china bowls to be placed, and
the pride of Rose’s existence, the diamond-cut wonder—the
crystal one? No one can carry them among
you here, and I must tell Sampson to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The two first on the piazza, the glass one in the
middle of the table,” answered Lisa, looking up from
her task. “I only hope Sampson will not serve
them like Philistines, with the exertion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think there is too much strength under
those woolly locks of his, Lisa, or do you fear a superfluity
of grace in his ‘fantastic toe?’” said Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that his ‘fantastic toe,’ as you are pleased
to dignify it, kicked over a pan of milk an hour ago,
when I sent him to the dairy, and these tricks have
not certainly power to make angels smile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samp want to white hisself for to-night,” said
his wife, showing her ivory as she looked at him.
“Miss Lisa never scold him for it, but you may
know I did, Miss Kate. What he do such ladicalous
things for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could not help it, Aunt Winny,” said Minnie
as she turned her dish of well frothed eggs to prove
her skill. “Now here is a magnificent float for
your ‘island.’ You know I always said that you
should make your favorite dish for my wedding-supper,
and this is an occasion quite as important. Here
is the sugar, sand and every thing you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank’ee, Miss Minnie. I’ll make it splendid,
you may know that. But dis an’t no wedding-supper,
my child, and it musn’t be so grand a floatin’
island as the bride’s. Ah! didn’t I make two for
Miss Kate and Miss Blanche if dey wos married in
de mornin’. I nussed you all—fine gals you is! Dey
an’t such young ladies for miles round, and please
God! I may live to see you all happy and lovin’ your
pardners as <span class='it'>them</span> do. My old mistress herself would
love to see ’em so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Winny left the room majestically—a pan on
her head and one in each hand, six little nigs at her
heels, each dismissed with a lump of sugar as they
went along in a straight line to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Winny grows eloquent, as she gets older,” said
Lisa. “If every body believed her, we would all be
like Miranda with every creature’s best. I wonder
what she will say when she sees us all dressed to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winny was not the only one delighted with her
young mistresses as they made their appearance in
the hall, one after another, and surveyed the beautifully
decorated walls of the several apartments opened
for the occasion. Festoons of cedar were hung around
and above, and beneath each were large bouquets of
fresh flowers, arranged in perfect taste. The orchestra
hung in scarlet cloth, was wreathed in roses and
evergreens, and surrounded by lamps placed so as to
illuminate these fairy bowers independent of the
glittering row of lights for the musicians. Stands of
exotics occupied one side of the hall, the fair and
tender buds throwing out a thousand perfumes on the
air, yet even these were not more fragrant than the
flowers of the season that hung around, the delicate
maiden’s-blush and the pale tea-rose. Long after the
chilly autumn winds have made us close our casements
and doors, these sweet sisters are blooming in
the gardens without, and from Mr. de la Croix’s
thick and extended hedges he had found a harvest
for his daughter’s ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could be more brilliant than the <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span>
of garden, house and avenue. Every nook
and corner had its light, every room its comfort, and
before the guests began to assemble Lisa had satisfied
herself that the arrangements for their enjoyment
were indeed complete. Her queenly form well became
the blue tarlatan with its moss-roses in bunches
of half opened buds. Her hair was simply twisted,
and in satin-like bands over her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche and Kate floated about in their pure white,
their elegance conspicuous from their simplicity,
while Rose and Minnie, like twin roses, were radiant
with beauty. The excitement had deepened the
color on their cheeks and brightened their eyes into
stars. Who wonders then at the father’s pride as he
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
looked at his crown of jewels this night? Who wonders
that the guests loved their pleasant smiles, and
treasured their gentle welcomes? No one was neglected
by them, not one in the whole crowd felt
forgotten or slighted, and the hours flew by as though
Time had laid his hour-glass in the green bowers
and slept at its side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie, Minnie!” whispered Blanche, “you talk
too heedlessly. Be more quiet, my dear girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, do not scold me to-night,” cried she, as she
leant half panting for breath upon her partner’s arm.
“Is it not a shame to scold me now?” And she raised
her bright eyes to his with a look that dazzled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a shame ever to do so,” replied he earnestly.
“Surely Mrs. Stuart you are not so cruel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only prudent, Mr. Milton, that is all; remember
this is my little sister’s ‘first appearance.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that she is one of the unsophisticated,”
said he laughing. “And by far more bewitching in
consequence,” was added in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche smiled and shook her head at him, but
they whirled off in a waltz before she could
reply, so she returned to her station by Kate, who
was talking in a very old-fashioned kind of way to—her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul and I were thinking the same,” said Kate,
as she placed her arm within hers. “Minnie is <span class='it'>tant
soit peu</span> inclined to flirtation, and we must warn her
before it becomes a passion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A passion, Kate!” said her husband smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a passion for admiration—for change, and a
sickly love of flattery that is beneath a girl like our
Minnie. How I do hope she will preserve that perfect
freedom from all affectation that is one of her
greatest charms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul made no answer, but as the quadrille broke
up, went forward to the object of this enconium as
she accepted her partner’s offer of a quiet promenade
after her dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie,” said he, “you have not danced with
me this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you have not asked me,” replied she,
putting her arm through his with an affectionate
smile. “I have felt myself quite neglected by you
and Kenneth, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just coming to claim you, Minnie,” said
Mr. Stuart, who had heard her last remark. “But
since I am supplanted this time, we are engaged for
the next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded to him and passed on to a group of
young girls who were talking gayly, and joined them.
One, a fair-haired blonde with a pair of melting blue
orbs, accosted her with a congratulatory remark upon
the entire success of her fête.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all delighted with every thing—with you
and with ourselves, par parentheses. But why does
not your father dance, Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and ask him,” said she laughing. “I have
not seen him dance since I was a little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he shall dance with me then,” exclaimed
the pretty questioner, “and I am going to invite him
for the very next quadrille.” And off she tripped to
find Mr. de la Croix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dance with you, my sweet young lady,” cried
he. “And what will all these gay and handsome
fellows say to my usurping their place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I show very good taste in my selection of a
cavalier,” was the reply. “You <span class='it'>must</span> dance with
me Mr. de la Croix because—I have said that you
must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little maid would have her will,” quoted he,
much amused. “So come, my little conqueror, I
could not refuse, even if an old man’s bygone steps
are shocking to polka lovers and sliding graces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have gained a victory,” said Miss Ashton, as
he led her to a place among the dancers. “See,
Minnie! I have chosen my own partner, in spite of
ceremony and etiquette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Age has its privileges,” observed Mr. de la Croix,
with a courtly bow, “and this is one of its most
pleasant advantages. I had never been so honored
but for my silver-streaked head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Mr. de la Croix!” said his young companion
archly, “your youth has only to return to put us to
the test. I’m sure you could tell us of bright eyes
that followed you wistfully in days of yore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little flatterer!” exclaimed he, as the music
struck up. “My age again has helped me to this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the gay girl bounded forward, and he watched
her graceful movements with so much pleasure that
he almost forgot his own part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie was opposite too, and seemed so delighted
at seeing her father dance, that he quite enjoyed an
amusement that had been for so many years discarded,
as one too frivolous for a <span class='it'>père de famille</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Selby had to follow his example, as Minnie
declared it his duty to do so, and thus her “first
party” was a perfect triumph, as not only the younger
but the older heads were giddy with their exertions
to amuse and be amused. It was nearly daylight
before Sampson had finished his task of putting out
the lights, and the hall, like all other banquet halls,
deserted. There were no heavy hearts carried away,
though many perhaps were lost to merciful finders,
and Minnie laid her young head on her pillow with
a feeling of consciousness that her debut had been
one of unusual and brilliant success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it proved, for during the season that followed,
no party of pleasure—no crowded ball was
complete without her presence. She was a perpetual
sunbeam, shedding light by her winning smile
and sweet temper. Her sisters accompanied her by
turns, and watched her flying steps with affectionate
pride; but Kate’s fears were partly verified, and her
young sister too fond of admiration to escape that
love of sway over the hearts of the many that seemed
to live but in her glances. In vain they warned—in
vain they lectured, Minnie had been too long careless
of advice to heed it now in this whirlpool of constant
gayety. Still artless, still unaffected, she dispensed
her smiles too lavishly, and fanned the flame
her varied charms had kindled, where she might
have spared her victims many a pang, had she heeded
the voice of reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have me cross to people?” said she
to Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
“No, Minnie; but seemingly less pleased with
their attentions. Did not Mr. Douglas have reason
to complain that you had encouraged him, when you
refused his offer last week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you that?” asked Minnie, crimsoning
to the temples. “Who told you that, Kate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Himself, and I could not but feel for his disappointment,”
said Kate earnestly. “I have seen you
look pleased at his assiduities—so pleased, that I
could not wonder at the reproach he made you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I granted him no more than I did to others,” said
the girl tearfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have a way, Minnie, of accepting homage
that is flattering to those who offer it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> am flattered, and return only what I receive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do not, my dear sister. What they offer
is too often sincere; they, then, according to your
mode of reasoning, have a right to expect the same.
Harry Lamfear left here in consequence of your refusal,
for, as he said, he could not bear to meet you
wherever he went, and I own that I thought you
were partial to him from a promise I heard you make,
to wear no bouquets but his for one month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are making mountains of mole-hills,” said
Minnie, blushing again. “I never dreamed that
such a promise was equivalent to ‘Certainly, sir! go
and order the furniture.’ I did like Harry Lamfear
exceedingly, but love was no part of the liking. I
told him more than once—more than twice, since I
must defend myself, that it was useless for him to
expect any thing more than friendship from me. I
could not refuse to speak to him—it will not do to
insult a man because he wants to marry you,
will it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decidedly no; but then you should have refused
to dance with him more than once in the evening—you
should have denied yourself on more occasions
than one, when he called. I saw you one morning
get up from the sofa, where you were suffering actually
with a headache, and dress your hair as becomingly
as you knew how, with a morning-cap
that was really a charming set-off to your piquante
style, and go in the parlor to receive him. You told
him of your indisposition of course, and his inference
was, that there must have been something <span class='it'>more</span>
than friendship to rouse you in the midst of pain, to
the exertion of entertaining him. Did it look like
indifference?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wrong there, sister,” said Minnie, rising
and seating herself beside her. “Tell me what I
must do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be kind and courteous to all, my little pink-cheek,
and do not listen with such a ready ear to the honied
words that make you giddy. Do not every week or
month select one on whom to bestow your favors,
but treat all alike indifferently until you really find
your own feelings enlisted. Then I need not advise,
your own delicacy, your own natural modesty will
make you every thing you ought to be. But for
heaven’s sake do not give people the idea, that you
are caught like a candle-fly by every glare, and wear
a battered down heart after your first winter is
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Kate, how matter-of-fact you are! Why
didn’t you say ‘pretty moth,’ and ‘withered heart?’
You shock me with your every day-isms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have very fastidious ears, Minnie, and I am
not jesting. There is one thing more to be said and
I have done. Beware of trifling with young Freeman.
He will not suffer himself to be led like his predecessors
if he is serious. And if he is, as I think,
merely playing your game of <span class='it'>flirting</span>, he will make
you regret ever having seen him. I do not like him—I
cannot look at him without a feeling of uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How foolish!” cried Minnie, laughing, “and
how ungrateful! he is always praising my charming
sister Mrs. Linden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so as to tell you immediately afterward
how much you resemble her,” said Kate gravely.
“I am not old, Minnie, but I am sorrowed, and feel no
longer young. Let what I have said this morning
be of some benefit to you, for your own sake, if not
for mine. I must watch and warn you, heedless as
you are to all counsel, and in so doing I make a sacrifice
that costs me something, for I might be conversing
pleasantly on other subjects, and feel secure
that my sister Minnie does not think me harsh and
disagreeable,” and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unjust!” cried Minnie, throwing her arms
around Kate’s neck, and kissing her affectionately.
“How very unjust! Do I not know how to value
your advice, Kate—am I so heartless in your eyes?
Heedless I am indeed, but not heartless, and I will
try and remember what you have said, that I may
act upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she did until it was forgotten, and young
Freeman’s devotion became once more a triumph to
the unreflecting Minnie. Her sisters rejoiced as the
end of the season drew nigh, as the entire summer
would be undisturbed by these constant amusements.
They would once more live in quiet after the gay
and to them tiresome winter, passed in following
their young charge from place to place, and in the
meantime a change might come over the “spirit of
her dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the opera that Minnie sat once more,
while Mme. —— enchanted and fascinated her audience.
Her bright eyes were fixed upon the sweet
singer, and she did not perceive the door of her box
opened to admit a gentleman, who took his seat and
gazed in silence at the lovely form before him. Ever
and anon he turned to Mr. Stuart, who stood behind
with a smile of pleasurable surprise upon his fine
open countenance, and watched with some impatience
the close of the second act of “Jerusalem,” in
spite of his love of music and the beauty of this
particular opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the curtain fell, and Minnie turned to speak
her delight to her brother. She started as she recognized
Harry Selby!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not but be flattered at the expression of
pleasure upon that speaking countenance, and the
fluttering of the little hand, which, for a moment,
rested in his; while Minnie read in those dark eloquent
eyes a story that sent the tell-tale blush to her
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
cheek, and forced her into a silence that provoked
and embarrassed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rose came to her aid, and poured inquiries
into his <span class='it'>not</span> over attentive ear. When did he arrive—when
did he sail? Where was his uncle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I arrived this morning—I sailed three weeks ago
from Liverpool to New York, and lost not a minute
in coming south, and left my uncle at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a perfect telegraph,” said Minnie, recovering
her speech. “Your friends must feel
highly flattered at your haste to reach them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” exclaimed he, fixing his eyes upon her,
“I felt that I could not trust myself to remain absent
any longer! I had so much to learn! so much to
lose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie turned to the stage and lifted her opera-glass,
while Rose smiled in spite of herself. Here
was a lover <span class='it'>comme il y’en a peu</span>. And as she contemplated
his handsome countenance expressive of
high and noble qualities, his attractive manner and
pleasant flow of words, she felt that Minnie was a
conqueror indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and dine with us to-morrow, Harry,”
whispered she, as he handed her in the carriage.
“And bring your uncle with you. Tell him I have
a japonica in full bloom and he must see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Rose!” was the reply, “you are an angel!
You do not mock the ear with promises—you mean
to keep them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they drove off at a rapid pace, leaving him to
rejoice over the beauty and fascination of his youthful
love, while she leaned back and wondered at the
beating of that hitherto quiet heart—the strange but
pleasurable emotion that seemed gushing from its
depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How remarkably he has improved!” exclaimed
she, turning to her sister. “How proud his uncle
must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proud indeed!” replied Rose. “And Harry’s
worth does not consist in his good looks, he has a
well-regulated, intelligent mind, a noble heart, and
that rare pride that scorns an unworthy thought. I
saw him constantly when I was in Paris, and I am
certain that he will fully justify the opinion I formed
of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage stopped at Mrs. Bliss’s door for Kenneth
and Blanche, and Mr. Selby came out to meet
his favorite. Minnie parried his questions as well as
she could, but Rose’s congratulations upon his nephew’s
arrival and appearance satisfied him, and he
accepted her invitation to dinner with unmistakeable
pleasure. He had intended to take them by storm,
but now Lisa would have warning, and be able to
fuss over them as they deserved, and he bade them
“good night” with a hearty shake of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the pleasant avenue wandered two graceful
forms a few weeks after this, the gentle tones of a
young girl’s voice mingling with the deeper, more
tender ones of a youth, who was gazing earnestly on
her deepening cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need not have told you, Minnie, for you knew
it that night at the opera,” said he pleadingly. “You
could not but see that I loved you as few love—that
in spite of time and space your image had remained
within my heart, its fondest remembrance. Tell me,
Minnie,” and he paused as they reached a vine-covered
bower, and led her to a seat beneath its
shade, “tell me honestly, did you not read all this
ere now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She trembled—her lot now was to be cast, her fate
determined, and there seemed a spell upon her, for
she could not speak; but there was no shade upon
that fair smooth brow, no anger in those softened
looks, and Harry, like many a one before him, dared
to interpret for himself what her own lips at length
were able to affirm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now to them the world seemed a paradise
indeed, and life one long summer day, o’er which no
cloud could ever come, to shadow their sunny hopes.
The blue sky seemed clearer above their heads—the
flowers were brighter, and the fair earth fairer still.
Happiness was theirs, for they were all to one another,
and as the hours passed unheeded, and the
gleaming stars burst forth into the quiet heavens,
they raised their eyes and likened their love to the
quenchless beauty of its countless lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, poor dreamers! ye are granted this one momentary
perfection of bliss! Ye can linger for once
over this dawn of promised light—for once ye are
convinced of its duration. But the sky must darken,
the lamps must go out—the flowers must perish—the
hopes must wither! There is but one hope—one
home of happiness—the home that is not to be won
without its pains, its fierce and mighty struggles, its
chastenings, that purify and fit the soul for the presence
of Him who promised it to the pure of heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Minnie had to wake from her dream of love,
but not yet—not until she was once more in the giddy
round of engagements for the spring. It was at Mrs.
Bliss’s last soirée that she was seen flying about like
a vision of light, while Harry Selby watched her
every glance. He had a right to be proud of her, for
she was his own—his promised one, and proud he
was. But a shade passed over his face as he beheld
her extending to another the same smiles she gave to
him; exerting for another the same fascinations that
bound him captive from the hour he first beheld her.
He did not intend, dear reader, that Minnie should
give up all for him; he did not expect her to be less
gay or less fond of dancing, but he could see no difference
now between her conduct to those around
her, and to him alone. He had a right to more than
they, but although Minnie’s engagement was generally
known, she allowed her lover to be pitied or
jested with upon the danger of marrying a flirt, who
cared more for admiration than for the love he bore
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am no advocate for the exactions or fastidiousness
of the stronger sex, exactions that in all cases
become that conjugal tyranny that drives us with
broken hearts to an early and welcome tomb. I cannot
uphold that constant recurrence to the difference
of duties and deportment that marked the single and
the married woman. The ceremony that binds in a
few moments, cannot change the disposition of eighteen
or twenty years—cannot blanch the dark braids
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
of the bride into a matron’s sober locks; and yet
there are few husband’s in the world who do not
frown and wonder, if before the honey-moon is half
over, he sees in his young wife the same ways and
manners of the unfettered creature he had sworn so
perfect, that her faults, <span class='it'>if</span> faults she could have, were
virtues. He had vowed that his life was a curse
without her, that he asked only her love in return
for his passionate devotion. But no sooner is she
won, no sooner is she the wife who has bound herself
to him “for better, for worse,” than he expects,
God help her! the sacrifice of every thought she has
to his prejudices, and never dreams how often she
has been shocked at faults and habits that tore from
her eyes the veil her own youth and inexperience
had helped to weave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harry Selby was not as a lover more exacting
than was natural and proper, and he had imbibed
some of Kate’s opinions concerning young Freeman,
knowing too, more than she did, to justify his aversion.
His devotion to Minnie de la Croix was not
at first sincere, for his object was merely to triumph
over others, and win a wager he had already made
to do so. But her indifference to all his protestations
enraged him, and her subsequent betrothal had
made him jealous, and proved how madly he had
learned to love her. He swore that he would force
her to dismiss his rival, and Minnie’s acceptance of
his attentions allowed him to dream of success in
spite of her coldness to his suit, and laughing answers
to his serious questions. He was well aware of his
powers; he was one of the most attractive of his sex,
witty, entertaining, and having that peculiar expression
of high respect in his manner, that is particularly
pleasing to women. Many would have
given up, with more success than he could boast of,
but he had vowed to revenge himself on Harry Selby,
and his friends had heard him; so around poor Minnie
a web was forming which her own thoughtlessness
but helped to strengthen. She was convinced
that Mr. Freeman fully comprehended her sentiments,
and thus excused herself for carrying him in
her train, unwilling to give up one who added so
much to her amusement, and the splendor of her
triumphs. In the midst of a merry argument upon
the rights of two waltzers that stood before her,
Harry approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you dance with me?” he asked, and offering
his arm to her. “I have waited patiently until now,
you were so surrounded!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, do you not see these two importunate
creatures teasing my life out? They want me to
waltz, when I am tired to death and want to rest,”
replied she, with a toss of the head that became her
amazingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I ask you to dance,” said Harry, earnestly.
“It is not so fatiguing, and I am but too
happy to remain here until the quadrilles recommence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the band began a waltz, a sweet,
bird-like clarionet pouring out its enchanting sounds,
and the young girl bounded from her seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Mr. Freeman, I cannot resist that!” cried
she laughing. “I must surely have been bitten by a
tarantula.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry drew back, and an expression of pain and
anger crossed his face as he watched Minnie and
her partner, who glanced at him with a look of
haughty triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hand was laid upon his arm, and Kate Linden
stood beside him. “As much as I dislike <span class='it'>him</span>,
Harry, I must put Minnie in the wrong. For God’s
sake, let there be no quarrels between men—I will
speak to Minnie. She loves you dearly, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves adulation more,” said he bitterly.
“Would to God I were not so madly fond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dance ended and Minnie returned to her
place, with brightened eyes and flushed cheeks.
Sending her companion for an ice, she turned to
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will dance with you, patient creature, if
you will wait a little longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” said he, more bitterly than
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started and looked at him, but laughed lightly
as she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very particular in commending my goodness,
but you do not seem pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Minnie; for I am too unhappy to conceal it,”
was his reply. “I had thought you loved me
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And since I did confess that love,” said she
haughtily, and coloring deeply, “by what right do
you doubt it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask others beside myself, Minnie; ask all the
world here, if this very hour you have not given me
cause to think myself weighed in the balance with
another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are jealous then. I had not deemed your
breast capable of harboring so base a passion,” said
she scornfully. “My actions are yet uncontrolled,
and I must beg leave to decline any dictation of terms
from your lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned pale with suffering, but remembered
her youth, and calmly met her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do me injustice, Minnie; I had no such intention
I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Mr. Freeman handed her a plate
of frozen strawberries, and a smile flitted over his
features as he remarked their own. It was evident
to him—there had been a dispute and he chose the
opportunity. Quietly approaching the musicians, he
gave them an order, and they began a mazourka
then much in vogue. Harry’s head was turned
away, and Minnie gave him a hurried glance as a
most melodious voice was entreating her to dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Mr. Freeman, smiling and gazing at
her, “is it forbidden already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand,” replied she in some confusion;
but when Harry looked up she was gliding over
the floor again, after reminding him of his own invitation.
He rushed from the room, and making his
adieus to Mrs. Bliss, drove rapidly home. It was
not easy to imagine his state of mind, but Kate followed
her sister until the mazourka ended, to warn
her of a coming storm. Taking her arm, she bowed
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
coldly to Mr. Freeman, who bit his lip and fell back
among a group of gentlemen, some of whom had
heard his wager and now laughed at his defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Defeat,” echoed he. “I have driven <span class='it'>il caro</span> off
in despair, and a few words more will settle all between
the charming Minnie and myself. Not that I
care particularly for her, but rejoice in the downfall
of Mr. Harry Selby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nous verrons</span>,” said a young man, who surveyed
him with a look of disgust. “Miss de la
Croix may like to flirt, but she loves Mr. Selby more.
And I for one doubt your success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had I but one quarter of an hour alone with her,
she would no longer dream of him. She loves me
now, and I will prove it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one touched him as he walked away, and
Paul Linden beckoned him to another room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister’s name is not to be sullied by such lips
as yours, Mr. Freeman. I hold you accountable for
what I have heard to-night, and trust you to prepare
yourself to be made so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed into the street, and angry words rose
between them, but when once more Minnie’s name
was pronounced, Paul passed his hand across the
face of the speaker and left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Kate! little knew she the “business” that
detained him the next day, and when at length
Blanche came to her with a white face and trembling
lips to prepare her for the dreadful news, she seemed
unable to understand until it had been repeated—that
her own husband was dangerously, though not mortally
wounded, in a duel with Mr. Freeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a loud shriek she became insensible, and
thus they lifted her into the carriage, while the rest
followed. Paul had been conveyed to her aunt’s,
and there lay weak and fainting from pain and loss
of blood. The ball had been extracted, and his poor
Kate was told to be calm! lest her agony prove fatal
to the one she loved beyond all earthly things. Calm!
when her heart was torn and bleeding, when there
was perhaps no chance of his recovery! But woman-like,
she strove against her misery and bent down to
kiss him, half fainting as she gazed at his pale face.
He turned to her with such a look of love!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not blame me, Kate, I would have died to
spare you a moment’s unhappiness, as careless as this
may seem of your feelings,” murmured he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Paul! for God’s sake hush!” cried she
clasping his hand. “Do I not know your love for
me? Do not speak my own husband—be assured that
I would never blame you. But for my own happiness
be careful and follow the doctor’s advice—be quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell asleep with his hand in <a id='hers'></a>hers, and she sat
beside him motionless as a statue, the big tears falling
over her face the while. She knew how much
she had at stake, she knew by what a mere thread
that precious life was hung, but she nerved herself
to restrain her wretchedness, to keep silent her torturing
fears, and tried to hope. Poor Minnie! throwing
herself upon her knees she entreated her forgiveness
for the pain she had caused—the tempest of grief
her fault had raised. Kate gently put her head
against her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor Minnie! my darling! who could refuse
your forgiveness? God knows you are suffering sufficiently
now—but oh! if <span class='it'>he</span> should die!” Her composure
gave way out of her husband’s presence, and
her convulsive sobs seemed too much for her strength.
They gathered around her frightened and weeping,
beseeching her to cease, lest her cries reached Paul
himself. A composing draught at length relieved
her, and this was her last indulgence of her sorrow
while a prey to such anguish as in vain assailed her.
From that day her fortitude never forsook her, and
neither loss of sleep or appetite were able to affect
her. Minnie shared her vigils—both were mere
shadows of their former selves, both watching with
pale faces and sunken eyes the patient sufferer.
Minnie left the room only when Harry Selby’s watch
came round. She had not seen him since the fatal
evening, nor mentioned his name after writing him
when the meeting took place. It was a touching
letter, and Harry bowed his head over it with a burst
of manly grief. It ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I write to say that you are free—you cannot but
wish it, after what has passed. You cannot but
hate one so apparently void of all feeling—so wickedly
frivolous. Forgive me for the pain I cause you,
God knows I am in need of pity! Should the worst
happen, I will be guilty of my brother’s blood, a
thought that maddens me. Farewell, I will always
pray for your happiness.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Minnie de la Croix.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And she drooped day by day, with a weight of
iron on her soul. Her sister’s sorrow—Paul’s suffering,
and the separation from her young heart’s
treasure were cankers, to eat away its hopes, and
wither its freshness. Her father, too—how much
he had changed, how gray he had become! How
sad her sisters were, how gravely Kenneth spoke!
The thought of their now deserted home, of its
once happy aspect. She thought of its cheerful,
merry-hearted inmates, and the light voices that
were now so low and sad. She remembered her
mother and the last blessing, the prayer that they
might be forever united—she remembered the dead
infant and Kate’s return—poor Kate! that she should
be the only sufferer! Gladly would she have laid
down her now darkened life for her sister—gladly
would she have sunk into the tomb, to hide her
bursting, breaking heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night she sat at the head of Paul Linden’s bed
after entreating Kate to go once around her aunt’s
garden and breathe the sweet spring air. Her face
was buried in her hands, and by the deep sighs that
shook her frame a portion of that young creature’s
misery might be conceived. On the opposite side
of the bed sat another, watching her, by the darkened
light of the sick room, with a look of deep compassion.
He had entered unperceived, and there
was a start of surprise as his eyes fell upon the
drooped figure. He could never mistake it—he knew
the outline of that once loved form—he knew the
little hands that were clasped across her knees, and
he held his breath least even that should rouse her.
Involuntarily he held out his arms, but at a movement
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
from the invalid she sprung to his side, and her
companion bent down to raise him as he asked for
some water. Minnie held the glass to his lips, and
replaced it on the table without raising her eyes to
his face, for she thought it was Kenneth; when she
turned to seat herself her eyes fell upon the figure of
him she loved! The blood forsook her cheeks, and
with a low smothered cry she covered her face once
more. When she looked again he was still there,
and his hand was held out beseechingly toward her.
Slowly she gave him hers, it was no bond of renewed
faith, she thought merely that he offered her
forgiveness, and he seemed now further from her
than ever, as she remembered this and looked at the
wounded man upon the bed. Sick at heart she sunk
back upon her chair and buried her head in the clothes.
The silence around them was painful now in the
extreme, and Paul’s heavy breathing fell like a reproach
upon her tortured heart. Years seemed to
pass, and when Blanche came in to take her place,
she breathed a prayer of thankfulness for the relief a
change afforded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hurried from the room out into the garden to
give vent to her wretchedness. She had then seen
him again—seen him, she resolved for the last time.
She had suffered too much for the last half hour to
dare it again, and she dwelt upon the remembrance
of his loved features as if to impress them more
deeply yet upon her heart. Alas! how wildly she
clung to him, now that she had bid him a last farewell!
how intense grew the love she had lavished
upon him with a woman’s bounty! She returned no
more that night to her brother’s chamber, for she
knew who watched beside him, but the lowly vigil
she kept within her own was an eternity of grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward daylight Lisa entered with a face of
joy. Clasping Minnie in her arms, she burst into
tears as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie, my poor child! he is saved! saved at
last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sunk upon the floor in a swoon, and during
Paul’s convalescence, another of the household lay
at death’s door. Day after day her fearful ravings
smote their heavy hearts, and a gloom seemed hanging
like a vast pall over them. Father, brothers and
sisters, grew pale and thin; but there sat one beside
that bed who seemed to grow old as he looked upon
the distorted countenance of his Minnie. His poor
blighted flower!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physicians did not despair, but they did not
bid them hope, and so a week passed—a week that
dragged by like a lengthened chain that overpowered
them. Then there came a gleam of light—</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Minnie opened her eyes once more to life.
Who can tell their joy—their prayers of thankfulness
as at length she knew them all? At the door now,
sat her lover, not daring to enter lest his presence
prove fatal, but as the tones of her sweet feeble voice
reached him, he leaned against the wall for support.
Rose wept silently at his side, and pressed his hand
as he called on Minnie’s name——they might yet be
happy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie’s first coherent inquiry was for Paul Linden,
and the news of his recovery was the first and
surest step to her own. He came to see her as soon
as he heard it, and tenderly kissing that pale thin
cheek, remained sitting by her with his hand in
hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you forgive me, Paul?” she asked, her eyes
filling with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear child,” replied he tenderly, “did you imagine
all this time that I could ever do aught but love
you? So do not speak of forgiveness again, we are
all too happy at your recovery to think of any thing
but joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How gratefully Minnie listened to all this, and how
much she prized the affection each in their turn was
striving to prove! She had awakened from a dream
of horror to a new existence. She had grown wiser—the
trial had purified her, and if at times her
thoughts would turn to the <span class='it'>happy hours</span> of the past—to
the blessing <span class='it'>his</span> love had seemed, she struggled
against the regret that stung so sharply, and bowed
her head to the justice of her punishment. It never
occurred to her, poor penitent! that Harry could love
her still, she thought her own conduct fully justified
his accepting the freedom she had offered him, and
heavy as the stroke came—deeply as it was felt,
Minnie looked upon it as her due, and bound herself
to suffer in silence—to battle with her troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning her father carried her out into the
garden, and seated her under a climbing jessamine
that covered a bower at the side of the house. Few
would have recognized the once gay and blooming
girl in the delicate creature that leaned back exhausted
in the chair—few could have realized the
active little sprite, the idol of the ball-room, in this
languid, helpless figure; but to her father and sisters
there was something sweeter than ever in their suffering
Minnie. A placid smile overspread her features
at the sight of the sweet flowers that bloomed
around her, and she held out her hand toward a
cluster of fragrant Lady Banks that grew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can tell you a secret of the loveliest bouquet
you ever saw, Minnie,” said Rose, gathering the
bunch of tiny roses for her sister. “A bouquet that
was sent an hour ago by a friend of yours and mine.
It is the eighth received to-day, and I reserved this
one as a <span class='it'>bonne bouche</span>, after all the rest. Now I am
going to get it while you sit here, and papa will
watch you until I get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father looked tenderly at his poor bird, and
stooped to kiss her. She smiled so gratefully in return,
that the tears sprung to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go home soon, father,” said she, holding
his hand; “we will go back to the old homestead.
I pine for my native air like a caged bird, and long
to be there again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He assented with a look of joy, for it was the first
time she had mentioned her home, and he fancied
she was stronger as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose came running back with the bouquet, and the
sick girl bent forward to receive it. Rare exotics
and simple flowers lay lovingly together, and round
the edge were rows of double violets—sweet flowers
of spring that gladdened her heart. How many times
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
she had sought them in the thickly bordered beds at
home! How often she had kissed them with childish
delight, when the fresh perfume had come like a
message to tell her the spring had breathed upon
them. And now they whispered of the old place
and its past joys—of the time that had elapsed since
she had been there, and the warm tears fell upon the
leaves like shining drops of dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who sent this bouquet, Rose?” asked she,
as her father walked toward the house. “Who sent
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One who loves you dearly, Minnie, and who
longs to see you,” replied she. “Will you let me
bring him here, dear sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him!” murmured the girl, as the color stole
slowly over her cheek. “<span class='it'>Him</span>, Rose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rustling among the leaves was heard—Rose fled,
and once more Harry Selby and Minnie were alone!
She gazed at him for a moment, and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry! why are you here, for God’s sake!” she
cried, as he knelt beside her and wound his arm
around the fragile form he had so longed to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why am I here, Minnie?” said he reproachfully.
“Can you ask me? Is it not to tell you once
more how dear you are to me—how wretched I have
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You love me still, then?” she said feebly, and
fixing her eyes upon him. “I am not worthy of
your love, Harry; I have deserved to lose it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie! Minnie! say not so! Whom could I
ever love as I love you? Whose memory has followed
me through long years but yours—what torture
have I not endured since last we met?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of gladness beamed from those beautiful
eyes, and she clasped her hands together. “My
God!” she whispered, “he loves me then in spite of
all!” and she bowed her head upon her knees.
“Loves me! after all that I have caused him and
others to suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you not suffered likewise, my own
Minnie? How little you knew me, if you supposed
for an instant that I could ever be happy without
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She learned to know him, reader; she learned to
feel how deeply he loved her, how noble and just he
could be, and the next day he bore her into the carriage
that was to take them to Oakwood, and took
his seat opposite to her, that he too might watch her
through the drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a gala day that—father and sisters, husbands
and the lover, his happy uncle and Mr. and
Mrs. Bliss followed Minnie to instal her with new
honors in her old home. Winny and Sampson
headed the procession that came to meet them, and
mingled their tears with the rest. Paul had become
a hero to them, Minnie a greater pet than ever, and
they both accepted the ovation as kindly as it was
meant. After dinner, as Minnie sat playing with
her beautiful fan, Harry took it gently from her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a secret in this fan, Minnie, unknown
to any but myself. Shall I unfold it for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She assented, and touching a spring in the little
mirror at the side of the fan, he held it up to her.
It disclosed a small, but perfect miniature of himself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave an exclamation of surprise. “Why,
Harry! your own dear self! Now I know who gave
me this fan—now I guess the sender of this exquisite
gift. To think how often I have used it, too, without
knowing its real value.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and pressed the soft hand he held.
“And do you not think me a vain fellow, Minnie,
mine, for having my own self, set into a frame like
this? See on the other side, dearest, what I dared
to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It flew open there and a ring fell out, a tiny bouquet
of the brightest diamonds upon it, and an opal
in the centre that changed its hue at every motion of
the hand. Harry placed the circle upon that taper
finger, and held captive the hand that owned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Minnie! I loved you so dearly that I
vowed to strive and win the very privilege I have
taken, of placing this ring upon your hand myself.
I will not let you go until you now tell me when I
may put another where this now is, that will bind us
closer yet. Tell me, Minnie, and make my happiness
complete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I suppose that Minnie told him, reader, for the
last time I was at Oakwood there was the happiest
bond assembled that earth can show. Kate, my poor
Kate! was the delighted mother of another girl called
Minnie, while a little Paul that ran about had a decided
resemblance to Harry Selby, the proudest man
alive. Blanche was beginning to look matronly with
her three treasures, and Rose was wandering down
the avenue with another nephew of Mr. Selby’s.
Lisa, my queen-bee, was herself still—I could not
say more for her, and Mr. de la Croix sat at the hall
door watching his children and grand-children with
a happy look. “They have suffered enough,” said
he to me; “but my crown of jewels, my friend, is
brighter than ever, after the breath of adversity for a
while dimmed its lustre. Kate and Minnie, poor
girls! have been in the storm, and felt its violence,
but the rest shared their sorrow until it became their
own. It was for the best, as all things are, and God
in his mercy chastened them without sending Death
among us again. They often recur to it, and while
Minnie deplores her fault, Kate weeps at the remembrance
of her dead child with a gentle sorrow, that
allows her to contemplate its happy fate with a
Christian’s view of the two worlds. It is not perhaps
my part to praise them, but take them all in all,
I do not think you will find a more cheerful, willing,
and dutiful band than mine. They have been and
are still, my crown of jewels.”</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oft have I dreamed of music rare and fine,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The wedded melody of lute and voice,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Divinest strains that made my soul rejoice,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And woke its inner harmonies divine.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And where Sicilia smooths the ruffled seas,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Tempe hollows all its purple vales,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thrice have I heard the noble nightingales,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;All night entranced beneath the bloomy trees;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But music, nightingales, and all that Thought</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Conceives of song is naught</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To thy rich voice, which echoes in my brain,</p>
<p class='line'>And fills my longing heart with a melodious pain!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A thousand lamps were lit—I saw them not—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Nor all the thousands round me like a sea,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Life, Death and Time, and all things were forgot;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I only thought of thee!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Meanwhile the music rose sublime and strong,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But sunk beneath thy voice which rose alone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Above its crumbled fragments to thy throne,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Above the clouds of Song.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Henceforth let Music seal her lips, and be</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The silent Ministrant of Poesy;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;For not the delicate reed that Pan did play</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To partial Midas at the match of old,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Nor yet Apollo’s lyre, with chords of gold,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That more than won the crown he lost that day;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor even the Orphean lute, that half set free—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh why not all?—the lost Eurydice—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were fit to join with thee;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Much less our instruments of meaner sound,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That track thee slowly o’er enchanted ground,</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Or glean around its sheaves!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I strive to disentangle in my mind</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thy many-knotted threads of softest song,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Whose memory haunts me like a voiceless wind,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whose silence does it wrong.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;No single tone thereof, no perfect sound</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A sound which was a Soul,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The Soul of sound diffused an atmosphere around!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So soft, so sweet, so mellow, rich and deep,</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Into diviner Death!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Softer and sweeter than the jealous flute,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whose soft, sweet voice grew harsh before its own,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It stole in mockery its every tone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And left it lone and mute;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It flowed like liquid pearl through golden cells,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It jangled like a string of golden bells,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It trembled like a wind in golden strings,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;It dropped and rolled away in golden rings;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then it divided and became a shout,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That Echo chased about,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;However wild and fleet,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Until it trod upon its heels with flying feet!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At last it sunk and sunk from deep to deep,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Below the thinnest word,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sunk till naught was heard,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But charméd Silence sighing in its sleep!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Powerless and mute beneath thy mighty spell,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My heart was lost within itself and thee,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As when a pearl is melted in its shell,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sunken in the sea!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I sunk, and sunk beneath thy song, but still</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I thirsted after more, the more I sank;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A flower that drooped with all the dew it drank,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But still upheld its cup for Heaven to fill;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;My inmost soul was drunk with melody,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which thou didst pour around,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To crown the feast of sound,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And lift to every lip, but chief to me,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whose spirit uncontrolled,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Drained all the fiery wine and clutched its cup of gold!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Would I could only hear thee once again,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But once again, and pine into the air,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And fade away with all this hopeless pain,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This hope divine, and this divine despair!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;If we were only Voices, if our minds</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were only voices, what a life were ours!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;My soul would woo thee in the vernal winds,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And thine would answer me in summer showers,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;At morn and even, when the east and west</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were bathed in floods of purple poured from Heaven,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;We would delay the Morn upon its nest,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And fold the wings of Even!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;All day we’d fly with azure wings unfurled,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And gird a belt of Song about the world;</p>
<p class='line'>All night we’d teach the winds of night a tune,</p>
<p class='line'>While charméd oceans slept beneath a yellow moon!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And when a-weary grown of earthly sport,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We’d wind our devious flight from star to star,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Till we beheld the palaces afar,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where Music holds her court.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Entered, and beckoned up the aisles of sound,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Where starry Melodies are marshaled round,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;We’d kneel before her throne with eager dread,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And when she kissed us, melt in trances deep,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;While angels bore us to her bridal bed,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sung our souls asleep!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh, Queen of Song! as peerless as thou art,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As worthy as thou art to wear thy crown,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thou hast a deeper claim to thy renown,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And a diviner music in thy heart;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Simplicity and Goodness walk with thee,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Beneath the wings of watchful Seraphim;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And Love is wed to whitest Chastity,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Pity sings its hymn.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor is thy goodness passive in its end,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But ever-active as the sun and rain—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Unselfish, lavish of its golden gain—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Not Want alone, but a whole nation’s—Friend!</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;This is thy glory, this thy noblest fame;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And when thy glory fades, and fame departs,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;This will perpetuate a deathless name,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where names are deathless—deep in loving hearts!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1351, the highest nobles of Castile had
left their cities, castles, and commands, and met together
in the ancient city of Valladolid, the residence
of the dowager of King Alphonso; for in this
city were to be celebrated the nuptials of Don Pedro,
King of Spain, and the beautiful Lady Blanche of
Bourbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plaza of the queen dowager’s Alcazar was
filled with an immense crowd of knights, citizens,
and attendants, through whom the heralds with
difficulty forced a passage for the procession which
now approached from the cathedral. Waves of
joyous music floated wing-like in the air, as a crowd
of gallant knights, headed by Don Fadrique de
Castilla, entered the square. Not in the stern panoply
of war were they clad, for the plumes and gorgeous
robes of festival fluttered gayly as the spirited horses
bounded and curvetted under the unusual restraint of
their slow procession-pace. After these came the
trumpeters and other musicians, and these in turn
were followed by a band of older knights, the glory
of Castile, the pride of chivalry. They were conducted
by the dignified and noble Alburquerque,
high chancellor of Castile, celebrated not more for
his valor than for the purity of his heart, and the
power of his intellect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheering of the multitude announced the king.
Mounted on a proud and milk-white steed; robed in
cloth of gold, which, as it waved in the air, displayed
the ermine lining; athletic and graceful in
form, and fair in countenance, Don Pedro slowly
moved amid the throng. The courteous smile which
should have answered the warm greeting of his
people bent not his lip; surrounded by devoted subjects,
wedded to a beautiful and lovely queen, he yet
wore a gloomy frown. But as he passed, his moody
demeanor was forgotten, and the cheering hushed to
a gentle murmur as peace lulled the storm on Galilee,
for who could rudely greet such a surpassing beauty:
“The queen! the queen!” Not the dark and gorgeous
beauty of the Spaniard, but the peaceful and
angelic sweetness of the north dwelt in Blanche’s
lovely face; not the glowing life of passion, but the
gentler spirit of love inspired her smile. Graciously
to the murmuring crowd she bowed the head just
circled with the regal diadem. No pride, no elation
crossed her features; joy and hope were the queen
and the bride of her spirit, and not a thought of doubt
or sorrow contested their empire. Her palfrey was
led by Pedro’s brothers, Don Enrique and Don Tella,
and her two noble knights and champions, Juan de la
Creda, and Nunez de Prado closely followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Queen Dowager of Castile, attended by the
Infante of Arragon, seemed, as she gazed around, to
be transported to the days of her own youth and
triumph, and watched her new daughter with a
joyous solicitude, which, however, sometimes gave
way to the mournful thoughts which her own sad
experience induced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the crowd were passed, and the cavalcade
entered the court-yard of the Alcazar. As the young
queen passed beneath the gloomy entrance-arch,
some unbidden foreboding of evil made her shudder.
Was that gloomy court the image of the coming life
for which she had sacrificed the joyous light of day?
Tears sprung to her eyes as she saw the king dismount,
and leave her knights to assist her from the
saddle; but she mastered her emotion, and was conducted
by the queen dowager and her own ladies to
her apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening the banqueting and reception-halls
of the Alcazar were gorgeously ornamented and
illuminated in preparation for the festival which was
to follow the queen’s reception of the court and the
nobility of Castile, who had assembled to do her
honor. Groups were collected by the windows and
recesses, and about the floor, discussing in low and
guarded words, Pedro’s singular inattention to his
royal bride. Many a lady’s bright eyes flashed the
indignation which she dared not utter, when she
thought or spoke of Pedro’s coolness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you not, Señor Inigo,” said an old noble,
in confidential conversation with the knight of Estuniga,
“that he hath left his love at Toledo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tis true; and were it not for Alburquerque, he
would not have been here this day. Heaven avert
all future sorrow from our gracious queen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” said the knight, “the young Padilla
nears us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tall and powerful knight, Garcia de Padilla,
cast inquisitive glances at them and other groups as
he paced alone about the hall. More than once his
dark countenance wore a deeper shade as some
chance word reached his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this juncture the doors of the reception chamber
were thrown open, and the king and queen were
seen standing beneath the canopy of a double throne,
which stood on a low dais at the upper end of the
room. Beside the queen stood the Bishop of Burgos
in his robes of state, Don Fadrique de Castilla, the
Viscount Narbonne, and several noble French and
Spanish ladies. Don Pedro was attended by the
Archbishop of Toledo, Don Juan, of Arragon, his
mother, and the Queen Dowager of Arragon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pedro’s mood was more gay than it had been
during the day, and Blanche again looked beautiful
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
and happy by his side. “Noble lord,” she said to
Alburquerque, who, as chancellor, was the first one
presented, “we have known thee well through the
mirror of other men’s praises, and hope to know
thee better as worthy of our own. Brave knight,”
she playfully observed to Esjuniga, “we may yet
claim the courage of him who bears thy motto,
‘Faithful to death.’ Could I own thy dignity, Lady
Inez, I might more fitly grace a throne. Thy dancing
eyes, sweet maiden of Sandoval, recall the valley of
home.” Thus, with gracious and courteous words
she received the homage of her new subjects, and
won the love and admiration of the throng.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony of the presentation over, Pedro and
Blanche led the stately dance of the day; but Pedro’s
brow was again clouded, and after the dance he did
not approach the queen. Blanche, accompanied by
the queen dowager and the beautiful lady of Estuniga,
promenaded the rooms, noticing and sympathizing
with the conversation and amusements of the various
groups of ladies and cavaliers. In the meantime
Pedro retired to a recess, and beckoned Garcia de
Padilla to him. After a short interview, the king
hastily crossed the reception chamber, and taking
advantage of a favorable moment, withdrew by a
private door. Garcia mingled with his friends and
gayly bore his part in jest and dance; but at last he
also quietly left the hall. Their absence was at first
unobserved by all but Blanche, whose self-possession
almost fled at the discovery, but she bore the desertion
without an outward change of manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A word with your highness, without delay,”
whispered Alburquerque to the dowager, as he passed
through a door which led to her boudoir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my sweet queen, Blanche, will accept the
escort of my sister of Arragon in my place, I may
crave the liberty of an hour’s retirement. The light
and gayety distract my older brain,” said the
dowager; and accepting Blanche’s kindly spoken
accord, she followed the chancellor.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Padilla, when he left the Hall, joined the king in
his antechamber, and the two made various hurried
preparations for a sudden journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the horses ready?” asked Pedro, quickly,
as his groom appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are ready, sire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the guard, Fernando?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In their saddles, sire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garcia, we will take a hasty meal ere starting,”
said Pedro, leading the way to a small dining-hall
which opened on the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely were they seated at a table by the window,
when Garcia sprung to his feet, and pointed to the
opposite corridor where the dowager and the chancellor
were seen moving toward them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They turn to the left, Garcia; they do not seek
us. How soon shall we reach Madrigala?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By four o’clock, if the night holds clear, and we
meet with no obstruction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When saidst thou did Maria arrive at Montalban?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The third day back, sire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Padilla spoke, a moment’s debate with the
guard was followed by the appearance of Alburquerque,
who conducted the queen dowager into
the room. Overcome by emotion, she knelt speechless
at her son’s feet, while tears streamed from her
eyes. Pedro, in spite of his surprise, rose and received
her with the greatest courtesy, but for some
moments she was unable to speak. When at last
she told him that she knew of his intention to desert
his queen for a former love, he affected extreme astonishment,
and disclaimed all such intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro!” she exclaimed, stung still more deeply
by his duplicity, “think not I am so easily deceived.
If thou seek’st not to join Maria de Padilla, why does
her brother accompany thee? Why does thy courier
precede thee to Montalban, where Maria now is?
Pedro, how canst thou so easily desert thy queen?
Bethink thee, thy court is with thee; the French
nobles are still here; Blanche’s friends are around
her; the ambassador of the French king is in yon
hall. What may not be the consequences of such
imprudence? Can such an insult be slightly passed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pedro, though very much surprised at the accuracy
of her information, was still unshaken, and
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet mother! thou mistakest me entirely. My
courier went to say that I should not go to Montalban.
I am suddenly called from festal joys to
meet a traitorous band who have ventured within
two days’ march of this fair city and thy home.
Come, Garcia, we must to horse. Señor Alburquerque,
I leave my mother in thy charge. Disabuse
her of her singular fears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indignant chancellor vouchsafed no reply to
such unmitigated falsehood, but led the weeping and
disconsolate dowager to her apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche retired early from the feast, and on joining
her new mother, her first question was for Pedro.
The information which had been acquired by Alburquerque
was too precise and certain to admit of
doubt; and as the scouts whom he had sent to observe
the king’s course, had confirmed it by reporting
him as being far on the road to Montalban, it had
been decided, perhaps unwisely, to inform Blanche
at once. The queen dowager, whose guest Blanche
had been since her entrance into Spain, loved her
as if she were indeed her daughter, and felt almost
as if the relationship were reversed, and Pedro’s
course had been the insult of some fickle gallant to
her own child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche had struggled with the auguries of ill
which had beset her since she entered the Alcazar
as a queen and bride; and her gentle nature, unused
to such harsh strivings, had almost sunk beneath the
accumulation of coolness and absence on the part of
Pedro, who should have shared with her the rejoicings
of the time. But when at last the queen dowager,
with every care and delicacy which affection could
suggest, displayed the unvarnished truth, she was
unable to control her feelings longer. “Gone!
gone from me!” she exclaimed, in bitter anguish;
“how could he leave the love which chained him
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
here! Burst not, my heart, before thy flood of grief!
Oh life! Oh love! Oh worthless crown! your dignity
is flown! Idle and hollow. Fierce Tagarote! to
plunge thy sharp beak in my life-blood! Oh Heaven!
give strength!” Trembling and exhausted she sunk
into the arms of the dowager, who placed her on a
couch, and covered her hands with tears and passionate
kisses. “Oh mother! has he indeed gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, be calm. God is with us. To-morrow
we shall know all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow! to-morrow! how like an evil genius
does it promise ill. To-morrow will have its own
grief. Tell me all to-night. Tell me his—his—Ah!
he is my husband yet. Never will I be false to
love and honor. Pedro—” The revulsion of her
feelings was more than she could bear, and she fell
back insensible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the dark hours which preceded morning
the mother watched her with the utmost care; and
as the bright dawn streamed through the lattice,
the chilled blood bounded once again with the full
speed of life, as if it sought the light. Sense and
memory returned, both chained forever to the fearful
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the anger and indignation of the
Viscount Narbonne, and the other French lords,
when the news of Pedro’s flight was known throughout
the city. Those who the day before had rejoiced
in the brilliant fortune of the idolized lady of Bourbon,
now cursed the hour in which she entered
Spain. The Spanish nobles of the court, themselves
felt degraded and insulted, and sullenly retired from
the city. The chancellor, a politic old statesman,
used every effort in his power to allay the fury of
the Frenchmen, but in vain. They endeavored to
persuade Blanche to return with them; but no entreaty
could prevail upon her to remove—and they
crossed the Pyrenees without her. Alone in her
new country, a wife, homeless and husbandless; a
queen, sceptreless and powerless, she did not despair.
Duty was the main star of her faith in life, and no
consideration of personal ease or even insult could
induce her to swerve from the fulfillment of its dictates.
Confident in the power of love and virtue,
she aimed to bring her erring lord to his allegiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chancellor, disgraced by his master, retired
to his fortress near Portugal, whither he was shortly
followed by Don Enrique and Don Fadrique, the half-brothers
of the king. The three, fully aware of the
energy and resolution of Pedro, not only made good
preparation for defense, but organized a formidable
rebellion, which had for its object the enthronement
of Don Enrique.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For a time Pedro’s movements were as erratic as
his stormy temper. Insurrection here, robbers there,
required his attention; but at last he sought a season
of repose at the Alcazar of Seville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reclined, one sunny afternoon, in the verandah
of the palace, while Maria de Padilla had left him
for an hour to enjoy her accustomed siesta. He
seemed thoughtful and uneasy; Blanche’s image
seemed to contend with Maria’s in his thoughts, and
conscience was not entirely at rest. His mood was
interrupted by the entrance of a tall and graceful
knight, who, with a low obeisance, delivered to
him a small missive, and then abruptly retired.
Pedro tore open the sealed silk covering, and opening
the letter, read the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My King and Husband</span>,—Were I not <span class='it'>thy wife</span>,
I should not strive to call thee back. The wild and
fickle falcon might rejoice in freedom. But now it
is my duty, as it is my happiness, to be with thee in
peace and storm, and therefore, by the right our God
hath vested in me, do I claim that thou allow me to
rejoin thee. What love can live without that
heavenly union in the soul which makes us one?
What sensual pleasure can bring peace to the o’er-tasked
and troubled life of royalty. The sympathy
of heart with heart, alone can feed the cravings of
the spirit, and bring a joy which Heaven sanctions.
Pedro, for thy own sake as for mine, I pray that thou
be with me soon.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Blanche.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The trembling hand, the variable brow, but slightly
indicated the tempest of the soul. Vague and uncertain
were his musings and intentions as Maria entered
the verandah. Smiling, she took the letter
from his hand, which mechanically yielded it to
hers; but her smile fled as she read it, and saw the
expression of his face. She handed the letter back,
but threw her arms around the irresolute lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thou wouldst leave me, Pedro,” she said,
in a low, deep tone, so plaintive in its modulation,
that the tears almost reached his eyes, unused though
they were to such a visitation. “Thou wouldst
leave me,” she repeated; “but canst thou forget?
Oh! not to the hours of dalliance, not to the day when
words of love thrilled to our hearts with unearthly
power, do I call thy memory now; but to those
darker hours when adversity broke in a thousand
waves; when death awaited his victim, and hope
seemed shrouded in the pall of despair. Whose
sympathy consoled thee then? Whose hand wrestled
through many fearful trials with the dark destroyer?
Whose heart grew cold with thine beneath
that awful pall?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro!” she exclaimed with a wild energy,
while the mournful shadow of her eyes gave place
to a brighter glow, for even that appeal was ineffectual.
“Pedro! if thou wilt go, go freely; but
remember that her heart has not yet learned as mine
has, to find its life in thine. If I had ever proved
myself less than a part of thee, thy true and real wife,
thou mightest now hesitate; but canst thou say that I
have ever let my own hopes, fears, or projects be
apart from thine? My life is thine. Wilt thou tear
me from thy heart? ’Tis thy own eye thou blindest,
and thy own tongue thou pluckest out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood before him, stately and magnificent; he
quailed before the fearful majesty which crowned
that brow with regal power; the kindling fire which
dwelt in those dark, glowing orbs beneath, seemed
to gleam with supernatural light upon the very inmost
motives of his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
“Go, go! if thou no longer lovest me I would not
have thee near; but my image will be with thee as
the mistletoe upon the oak. Thou canst not leave or
kill it, till thy own life fails; ’twill rise at every
hour of thy life in judgment on the heart which
dared not keep the holiest treasure man can win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes met hers with a clear firm gaze. “It is
over,” he said. “When honor hath two calls love
shall be the arbiter.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Alburquerque being now banished from the court,
Henestrosa, the uncle of Maria, became his successor,
and he and Maria’s brother, Garcia de Padilla,
became the confidants and advisers of the love-bound
monarch. Fortunately Maria’s love was not so selfish
as their ambition, and her empire over Pedro,
that of a powerful intellect and an enthusiastic
spirit, was often used for the behests of gentleness
and mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pedro felt but too keenly his <a id='anom'></a>anomalous position.
His secret marriage with Maria, to whom his honor
and his love alike constrained him to be just; his unprincipled
conduct towards Blanche; the loss of old
and attached friends; the evident displeasure of his
subjects, and the machinations of those whom he
had so suddenly disgraced, filled his mind with many
fearful struggles. Too unprincipled to be capable of
sacrifice or concession, his endeavor was to reconcile
all parties without compromising himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While in this fevered state, and uncertain of his
future course, he ordered Henestrosa to remove
Queen Blanche to Toledo, and confine her in the Alcazar.
The citizens, at first suspicious of Henestrosa
from his relationship to Maria de Padilla, at
last concluded, with questionable justice, that the unfortunate
circumstances which environed Blanche
were owing chiefly to his influence; and rising in
sudden insurrection on his arrival forced him to allow
the queen the choice of her asylum. She chose
the church of St. Mary. But the citizens, fascinated
by the grace and dignity of Blanche and emboldened
by their success, forced the chancellor to retire, and
themselves assuming the office of her protection, escorted
her with all respect and pomp to the Alcazar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Established in the ancient palace of Toledo, and
faithfully guarded by her loving subjects, she was
soon joined by several of the noblest cavaliers of
Castile. Don Enrique, Don Fadrique and the ex-chancellor
had collected an army, with which they
had advanced to Cuidad Roderigo. Hearing of
Blanche’s arrival at Toledo, Don Fadrique with a
large body of <a id='cav'></a>cavalry joined her protectors, and swore
fealty to her cause. He was soon followed by his
companions, and the trio made Toledo for the time the
head-quarters of their army. Pedro fired with resentment,
ordered his forces against them, with the
double intention of vanquishing the rebels and regaining
possession of his queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations for the expected siege absorbed
nearly all the attention of the conspirators, and they
had no leisure to observe the uneasiness of Blanche.
She now began to perceive that they had hidden
from her their real object, which was the dethronement
of the king. At last, unable to bear longer the
pain of even appearing by silence to acquiesce in
their designs against her husband, she sent for Don
Fadrique and disclaimed all connection with their
schemes of rebellion. No arguments could change
her determination, and the stern warrior was forced
to yield to the resolution of the gentle lady. It was
now too late to leave the city, for Pedro’s troops encircled
the walls, and Blanche, anxious for the protection
of her subjects, while unwilling to countenance
any attempt to dethrone Pedro, did not wish
to place herself in his power until assured of his
good intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day of battle was for her a day of trial. Though
she prayed for the success of the king’s forces, she
feared that success for them would place her in the
power of him who had attempted to imprison her in
the very palace she now occupied. Sometimes she
could hear the noise and shouting of the combatants,
and for several hours she awaited with the greatest
anxiety the messengers who should announce defeat
or victory. Her suspense was ended by Don Fadrique
himself, who at the head of a guard of knights
rode suddenly into the palace court and besought her
to fly immediately with him to a place of safety before
Pedro’s troops entered the city. But she had
resolved to be no longer a tacit partner with those
who were Pedro’s enemies. In this she was inexorable,
and Fadrique went alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had Fadrique passed the gate of the city,
when a guard of Pedro’s knights rode rapidly to the
Alcazar. As the iron hoofs of their steeds resounded
in the court-yard, the heart of Blanche quailed before
the gloomy picture of her future. The gentle
strength with which she had borne the uncertainty
of the hours of battle gave way, and for a time she
lay on her couch in an agony of tears, but mustering
all her fortitude, she prepared to meet the envoy of
King Pedro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The singular dignity and grace which had shone
prëeminent in the brilliant court of Charles, were
with her now, though blended with a quiet sadness,
which by adding a softer element, enhanced her
beauty. Her grief had pictured a dark and fierce
janitor, and great was her surprise when the noble
and generous knight of Estuniga approached, and
bent the knee in homage. He was so deeply affected
as to be unable to utter a word, and the dignified
composure with which Blanche had armed herself,
fled at the unexpected rencontre. At last the knight
spoke, though in a low and broken voice—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My liege, I come to redeem the claim you did
once make upon my motto, ‘Faithful to death,’ and
you shall never find it dishonored. Though I am
ordered to be your governor, you are henceforth my
guest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, noble knight! thy presence came as light in
the storm. Where we had pictured the sharp flash
and the rude thunder, came the gentle air of peace.
May Heaven visit thee with the reward we cannot
give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, speak not so, my honored liege. It will be
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
necessary for your safety, that you appear as my
prisoner till we leave these walls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As thou wilt, Señor Inigo, I trust all to thee.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright and glorious day. The sun shone
in an unclouded sky, and lighted brilliantly a deep
and lovely valley of the Tagus, some two days to the
westward of Toledo. A gallant cortege had just
halted on the mountain’s brow to gaze at leisure on
the beautiful vale which lay outspread beneath. To
the left the Tagus foamed through a gorge, and then
meandered through the more level ground till it was
hidden among the mountains which again approached
its banks a few miles on its course. In the centre of
the valley on the bank of the river, rose the towers
of a stately castle, which lay embowered in thick
groves of evergreen. It was evidently not intended
for defense against a serious force, and had the appearance
of a winter retreat from the cold and nipping
air of safer military positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold thy new home,” said Estuniga to his
queen, who gazed in admiration on the landscape.
As they slowly descended the mountain many a
scene of wild and remarkable beauty met their gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the castle of Estuniga Blanche led a life of
peace for a time, and obtained the title of “the good”
from her exemplary charity and beneficence. The
Lady Leonora de Estuniga, generous and hospitable
as her lord, bestowed every care, and performed
every office which could minister to the happiness of
her idolized guest. Still she was not happy: she
yearned for that sweet communion of wife with husband,
than which there is no greater joy, and often
resolved to present herself to Pedro and claim her
rights by the wiles of love and eloquence. But Estuniga
knew his master better than to permit her to
place herself so rashly in his power. He hoped that
Pedro’s romantic love for Maria would fade from
his heart; he knew not that a deeper tie than that of
romance bound them, that the peculiar and spiritual
sympathies of character which mark the true marriage,
linked them irrevocably together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He never relaxed the guarded discipline which
was required to prevent surprise, and his scouts daily
traversed the country on the look-out for enemies
and information. One day they reported that a dozen
knights, bearing the banner of the Maestro of St.
Jago, approached the castle. Estuniga knowing not
whether they came as friends or foes—as foes they
had last met—and with some anxiety for his royal
guest awaited their mission. At the castle gates
Don Fadrique de Castilla, the <a id='maest'></a>Maestro of St. Jago,
announced himself a friend to the King and to Estuniga,
and accordingly he and his friends were received
with honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fadrique soon explained the cause of his presence
on the Tagus. After his defeat at Toledo, he suspended
all hostile proceedings, and meeting the king
before St. Catherines, and proffering his allegiance,
he was freely pardoned for all past offences and was
promised favor for the future. Soon after this he received
a command from Pedro, and acting in his service
took for him the fortress of Jumilla. He was
now journeying from his commandery to Seville at
the earnest invitation of the king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queen Blanche graced the evening feast with her
presence, and in truth two such noble ladies as the
queen and Leonora were rarely seen. The stronger
lineaments and more splendid presence of the hostess
enhanced the delicate and graceful beauty of her
guest, and themselves received advantage from the
contrast. The maestro took occasion to renew the
offer of the services which Blanche had refused when
he fought against the royal power. After a consultation
with her host, she decided to make the maestro
her advocate with Pedro, and gave him full
power to arrange the renewal of the nuptials which
had been so suddenly and harshly suspended. Fadrique
was eloquent and resolute, and she hoped
much from those qualities, and from Pedro’s former
attachment for him. Hopeful and expectant she saw
him depart upon his mission, and consecrated it with
many a silent prayer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Moorish Alcazar of Seville was situated on
the banks of the Guadalquiver, and its bowers were
renowned as the most delightful in Spain; yet they
did not always resound to tones of joy and gladness.
Sometimes Pedro’s violent temper displayed itself
there, and the arching groves were silent witnesses
of the fatal words of death. Oftener, however, they
were graced by the presence of the king and Maria,
and her gentle lute breathed a harmony which sometimes
found a response in Pedro’s stormy spirit. At
such moments he was singularly fascinating and
graceful, and all that had in youth been gentle,
seemed to flow into his maturer manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king and Maria reclined upon a flowery bank
which sloped down to the river, and Maria, touching
her lute, attempted to dissipate the portentous gloom
of Pedro’s sadness, and at first with a proud and
lofty voice, and afterwards in a sweet and harmonious
manner, sung these verses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Fadrique dies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A page, interrupting them, announced Don Fadrique’s
herald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bid Reboledo and Don Juan of Arragon meet me
in my closet. Go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, to-morrow, gentle Maria,” said the
king, as he hastily strode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diego Perez de Reboledo, and his friend the infanté,
speedily attended the summons of Pedro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Fadrique has arrived,” said the king, in a
careless tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen him, sire,” was the reply of Don
Juan. “Know you that he is the envoy of Blanche
of Bourbon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! is it so?” continued Pedro. “Señor Diego,
there is a deep grudge between you and him; and I
know that he is plotting against my crown. And
even thou, Don Juan, losest no love toward him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your meaning, sire?” said Reboledo
with a sarcastic smile. “You may speak plainly
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have him leave these walls. Thou
knowest the proverb, ‘Teach the falcon while he is
thine.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, then; he shall be severely taught, an’ it be
your will,” said Reboledo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plainly, he must be dispatched, Señor Diego, and
I trust to thee to have it done. As for the act, my
guards will not be wanting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some slight arrangements, made as coolly as
if for a festival, the prince and Reboledo left the king
to his own thoughts, which certainly were far from
agreeable. Distrust is the inevitable poison of those
who themselves break trust, and Pedro dared not
leave the performance of the deed to his accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They might have some secret cause of hatred toward
himself, and might save his intended victim for
the furtherance of their own schemes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Maria’s chambers overlooked the groves and
bowers of the garden, beyond which flowed the
river, while the dim and distant sierra formed the
horizon. It was morning, and she sat by the balcony
instructing her dark-eyed, graceful daughter in
the mournful but harmonious music of the time. Her
attitude was very listless, and her dark lids rose not
from the eyes which seemed too sad for tears. Soon
she gave up her task but watched the child, as in the
exuberance of youthful spirit she danced before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, my daughter!” she murmured, “what fate
is thine. Born to a royal heritage, thy uncertain fortune
may sink beneath the wave which bears a rival
to its haven. Yet—yet I dare not ask the boon which
is my right before the world, as it is here. If I should
claim the crown, he would not give it till he had
murdered Blanche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was too true. With Pedro life was nothing in
the scales of interest or impulse. And dearly as he
loved Maria, he was too conscious of the policy
which was necessary in his situation, to dare to proclaim
her queen and her children heirs to the throne,
while Blanche was yet alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Fadrique who had known Maria in Toledo,
was announced by her page and was admitted to her
presence. Kneeling, he kissed the hand of the Padilla
whose beauty he remembered, and which he
found still as remarkable as ever, but of a darker, yet
a gentler cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, Don Fadrique, to this our calmer
home,” she said, and pointed to a seat near that from
which she had arisen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your grace, the true divinity of these fair
bowers, I trust may ever find in them a home of
peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The serpent’s sting is everywhere, my lord, and
even here Death contends with Life.” She intended
the words, and the look which accompanied them,
for a warning, (a clearer one she dared not make,)
but he understood her not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maestro, charmed with the beauty of the Alcazar
and the loveliness of Maria, ceased to wonder
at Pedro’s fascination, and felt but little hope from
any mediation in the cause of Blanche. But his
word was passed to the queen, and his honor,
even without that pledge, impelled him to its fulfillment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour had passed most agreeably, when the king
sent Garcia de Padilla to request his presence in a
private interview. As they walked through the
rooms, and as he observed that few persons were to
be seen, and that all the doors were guarded, a suspicion
of the truth crossed his mind; but his resolute
and generous nature repelled it. The king was in
an inner apartment beyond the presence-chamber,
called the “chamber of iron,” whose doors were
guarded by several mace-bearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fadrique had only time to notice that Garcia and
he were the only guests, when the door of “the
chamber” was opened by Reboledo, who called to
Fadrique to go into the king. Gently freeing his
sword arm from his mantel, he entered, and was followed
by Reboledo and the mace-bearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seize the maestro!” said Pedro, in a stern voice
to the guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should a king play the traitor?” said Fadrique
in a lofty tone, as he drew his sword and placed his
back to the wall. “We are of Castile, my lord; her
sons must be worthy of their heritage even in
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Villains!” exclaimed Reboledo to the guards,
who hesitated to attack the gallant Fadrique, “do
you not hear his grace’s order to kill the maestro?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
In a few moments, though not without a brave defense,
the Maestro of St. Jago was no more.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When the news of Fadrique’s death reached the
castle of Estuniga, a profound grief visited its inmates.
This last act of perfidious cruelty destroyed
all the hopes that Blanche had founded upon Pedro’s
better nature. To invite Fadrique to the capital, and
then to meet him with death, was so infamous that she
no longer even wished for a reunion with her husband.
Her heart now told her that the throne of Spain was not
the home for her, and she once more yearned for the
land she had forsaken for a fate like hers, and a husband
such as Pedro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time Estuniga and the Lady Leonora were
seriously disquieted, in consequence of a command
which Pedro had sent to the knight, to treat his
queenly guest as he himself had treated Fadrique, in
other words, to put her to death. To execute such
a command was for him impossible. Every principle
and every feeling of his nature revolted from the
slightest injustice, much more from a deed as fiendish
as this. He sent back an indignant refusal, and
saw the necessity of some energetic movement in
order to secure Blanche’s safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that Alburquerque was at or near Toledo,
still unpardoned by the king, he resolved to meet him,
and with him concert, if possible, some feasible
scheme for the escape of the queen. Leaving Blanche
in care of his lady, to whom he gave command of the
castle in his absence, he set forth with a promise to
return within six days. Blanche knew not of the
king’s message, nor of the purpose of the knight’s
sudden journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But unfortunately Pedro’s distrustful and uneasy
spirit could not rely on Estuniga’s fealty, and long ere
his evil messenger had returned to Seville, he ordered
Reboledo to add another to his list of crimes, and
sent him with a force of troops to take Queen
Blanche and murder her. This remorseless satellite,
whose life reflected his master’s, was not apt to fail
in the distasteful task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the second morning after the departure of the
Knight of Estuniga, a goodly train was at the castle
gate, and their herald claimed admittance for the
troop. The Lady Leonora’s lieutenant, an aged
warrior, who had been knighted by her father, recognized
the pennon of Reboledo and advised her not
to admit them, until she knew the object of the cold-blooded
Diego. Accordingly he went down to the
wicket, but soon returned to inform her that the purpose
of the visit was to gain possession of the queen.
Further information he could not gain, but Reboledo’s
character and her well-founded suspicion that
he had been an instrument of Fadrique’s death induced
her to refuse admittance, and if he attacked
the castle to defend it if possible until the return of
her lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her old knight, Roberto, she gave the necessary
authority over all the force within the walls.
Fortunately Estuniga had left the castle in the best
state of defense of which it was capable, and though
not adapted to a regular siege, could, it was thought,
be defended against the light force of Reboledo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Leonora and the queen were not kept long
in suspense, for Reboledo soon prepared for the attack.
He had ascertained that the knight was absent,
and not knowing when he might return, resolved
to accomplish his purpose without delay. Roberto
had divided his force between the only two points
which were assailable by the enemy, the draw and
the postern. The best marksmen were stationed at
the draw, while above the postern he soon had a
supply of melted lead and pitch, which were almost
the only weapons there available. Several slight
attacks were made during the morning, more for the
purpose of ascertaining the force of the defenders
than with the expectation of penetrating into the
castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon Roberto observed preparations which satisfied
him that the struggle was about to commence
in earnest. A furious assault was made upon the
draw, and while flights of arrows passed between
the besiegers and the besieged, a band of sturdy axe-men
endeavored to get at the drawbridge for the
purpose of cutting it down. The vigilance of Roberto’s
bow-men prevented their success, and they
were repeatedly forced to retire. In the meantime,
Reboledo supposing that the principal force was diverted
from the postern, attacked that part of the
castle. Having during the morning ascertained the
means of defense in that quarter, he had hastily constructed
a large shield capable of protecting several
men from the arrows, lead, and pitch. Under the
shield several axe-men advanced to the charge,
while a party of bow-men strove to prevent the besieged
from molesting them. Roberto was not so
easily entrapped, and the assailants after a fruitless
battering at the postern gate, were driven back with
the loss of several men and their shield. The attack
in front was now continued with nearly the entire
force with but little better success. A number of the
enemy were wounded, and several were killed,
while but a few of Roberto’s men were injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wane of the afternoon another shield was
constructed, and Reboledo, incensed to a fiendish
bitterness by the unexpected vigor of the defense,
after a desperate assault succeeded in injuring the
postern gate ere being again driven off. A new attack
was at once commenced in order to complete
the work, and was supported by a heavy force of
bow-men and mailed soldiers. In a few minutes
the gate was open, and a fierce hand-to-hand
fight took place in the archway. Roberto headed
the defenders, who forced the assailants to give way,
till Reboledo himself entered the vaulted passage,
and with his herculean strength bore down all opposition.
Roberto fell while gallantly stemming the
torrent of success, and his men after a brave defense
were overwhelmed. The castle was soon entirely
in the power of the assailants, and Reboledo at once
made all the necessary dispositions for defense, in
case it should prove necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ordering the butler to furnish supper in the
dining-hall, he sent the seneschal to deliver to the
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
ladies a courteous and knightly invitation to appear
at the evening repast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the siege the Lady Leonora had informed
Blanche of Pedro’s intention and of the cause of
Estuniga’s absence. Shocked at the fate which
seemed to impend over her, and confident that Reboledo
was the tool of the king, she at first resolved
to refuse her presence in the hall; but her hostess
showed the futility of the refusal, and the necessity
of appearing to be friendly to the victor. They were
indeed completely in his power, for though they had
contrived to send two messengers away at the moment
of defeat, there was no chance for them to escape.
Leonora’s policy was to endeavor to retain
Diego in his present position till her messengers
should have apprised Estuniga of the aspect of affairs
and he could recover the castle and the prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair ladies,” said Reboledo, as the queen and
her hostess entered the hall, “I am well aware that
in ordinary courtesy I should have been the guest at
this table, and therefore beg that you may so consider
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Leonora, though incensed at the covert
sarcasm of this speech, true to her policy, answered
it with a polite courtesy which surprised both her
“guest” and the queen. No further reference was
made to the events of the day, and Reboledo, who
was in manners an accomplished cavalier, entertained
the ladies with such gossip as was interesting
and customary. Their own seneschal was in the
hall but did not approach the table, and they observed
that the two pages who attended them were strangers.
As they were about to leave the table, the
knight turned to the Lady Blanche, whom he had
addressed by the title of “your grace,” and inquired
when she would be ready to rejoin her royal consort.
Surprised at such an unexpected question, she
did not reply for a moment, but promised to answer
him in the morning, “for,” she added, “I am not
well to-night, and cannot say but I may be too ill to
go to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently satisfied with the answer, he gracefully
escorted the ladies to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ill, Lady Leonora, very ill,” said Blanche,
breathing shortly and throwing herself upon a couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! a consuming fire flies through my veins.
Give me some drink. How I thirst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Leonora, though skilled in the leech-craft
of the time, was utterly at a loss, and what to
do for Blanche she did not know. There was no
leech or friar in the castle. For a few minutes she
gave her wine and water to assuage her raging
thirst, and bathed her burning temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Blanche raised herself to a sitting position,
and while her face was convulsed with agony,
exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware Leonora, I am poisoned by——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This world and all its sorrows had passed away
from her, and her pure spirit, freed from the material
fetters of this earthly life, had reached its eyrie,
basked in the pure light, far above the storm and
darkness of the valley.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY FAYETTE ROBINSON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>François Auguste, Vicomte de Chateaubriand,
was born in 1768, in the midst of that epoch which
produced so many great men, Napoleon, Soult, Wellington
and Walter Scott. Educated at the castle of
Combourg near Saint-Malo, beyond all doubt as he
wandered over the arid lands and desolate shores of
Armorica, young Chateaubriand felt the development
in his soul of that inclination and solitude
which never abandoned him even in the turmoil of
business and amid the gravest political affairs. Intended
originally for the church, it was subsequently
purposed to devote him to the army; he began
at Dol and terminated at Rennes, an arduous course
of study, which though it left his intense sensitiveness
and that creative imagination which are the
chief characteristics of his mind unaltered, enabled
him to publish serious works on critical history, at
an age when persons usually possess but vague notions
of life and the principles which regulate the
organization of society. In 1787, for the first time,
young Chateaubriand went to Paris. He was at that
time a second lieutenant in the regiment of Navarre,
but so as to be enabled to ride in the king’s
coaches, an honor to which from his old nobility, he
was entitled, the rank of captain was necessary, he
obtained by a fiction, not unusual at that time, the
brevet of captain of cavalry; notwithstanding this
however, he continued to do duty in the regiment of
foot to which he belonged. The magnificence of
the court of Versailles could not at all satisfy the
vague desire, which, though he did not then understand
its nature, tormented his soul. Adventure
was a condition of his being; his life could not be
objectless, and with delight he hailed the commencement
of a career. One day as he looked over a map
of the New World, he was struck with the possibility
of discovering a passage to the northern Pole.
From that hour sleep and repose were gone. Like
Columbus, he went from door to door, to solicit
means to realize the idea which animated him, and
was compelled to submit to the ridicule of some,
and the indifference of others. This idea, which
then was esteemed insoluble, but a short time after
was realized. It may be, had the government of
Louis XVI, paid any attention to a question which
had great significance in the points of view of commerce,
politics and science, that passage, now known
as McKenzie’s, would have borne the name Chateaubriand.
Let this however, be as it may, the young
second lieutenant, by ridicule and discouragement,
resolved to accomplish his gigantic project without
assistance, and in the spring of 1791, set out for
America, with no other baggage than a letter of introduction
to Washington. Yet imbued with the
ideas of the old world, Chateaubriand had imagined
the President of the United States, a king, surrounded
by a brilliant court, with guards and chamberlains,
crowding the portals of a palace of marble
and gold. How great must his surprise have been,
when he knocked at the door of a modest dwelling,
which, in France, would have been esteemed scarcely
fit for a private gentleman, and when a female
opened the door, and without parade let him into the
presence of one who had created a nation and declined
a crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington received him with cordiality and
kindness, but terrified beyond doubt at the dangers
to which he was about to expose himself, attempted
to dissuade the young adventurer from his enterprise.
Chateaubriand, however, would not be persuaded,
and soon after hired a guide and really began
his journey, fancying that he had merely to go
straight to the Pole, as he had gone from Saint Malo
to Paris. He reached the limit of civilization, in
what was then considered a short time, and with indescribable
joy found himself amid the dark and
mysterious forests of the new world, where it seemed
<span class='it'>to him</span>, no human foot had ever been planted before.
He thus describes his sensations, when his
soul first became replete with astonishment and
amazement at the magnificence of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wandered from tree to tree, now turning to the
right and then to the left, saying to myself, here
there are no beaten paths, no restricted dwelling
places; presidents, kings and oligarchies, have no
power here. By way of exhibiting my freedom
from all control, I committed countless wild pranks,
which made the steady Dutchman, who was my
guide, fancy me a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young lieutenant, however, looked anxiously
for one of those Indian villages, in which the children
of nature, the men of the soil, might certainly
be found. His first essay, however, by no
means impressed him favorably in relation to the
true Native Americans. After a journey of several
days, he saw in the depth of a forest, compared
with which, all France was but a park, a wigwam
from which strange sounds issued, and which in
that place must have astonished him indeed. He
listened with attention, and heard a well known
“<span class='it'>chant populaire</span>” of France, with an accompaniment
wrung from a violin, which certainly, Stradivarius
never made. The wanderer entered the hut,
and amid a bevy of Indians, who danced as if Saint
Vitus had touched them, he saw an old man of diminutive
stature, with his hair “<span class='it'>à l’oisseau royal</span>,”
with a green coat, a coarse vest, cut however,
<span class='it'>à l’agonie</span> de Louis XV., ruffles and wristbands of
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
coarse cotton, busy in teaching a dozen Iroquois to
dance the cotillion and <span class='it'>minuet de la cour</span>. The
teacher’s name was Violet, and strange to say, he was
the progenitor of that individual of the same name,
made so famous by the late Captain Marryatt. Violet
had been a servant of the Count Rochambeau,
and had been induced to establish himself on one of
the little lakes in New York, amid the Iroquois.—French
nature and human nature are however, different
entirely, and the <span class='it'>valet de chambre</span> had <a id='beg'></a>begun
to civilize North American Indians, from the <span class='it'>point
du départ de la danse</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young adventurer in a short time left his
countryman and resumed his journey through the
wilderness. He soon met with Indians far less civilised
than the Corypheans of Violet. He was kindly
received by various tribes which he visited, and
participated in their councils and their wars. At
this period of his career, he collected the variety of
information, which was ultimately fused into Atala,
René and the Natchez. It cannot but be regretted,
that Chateaubriand never chanced to grasp the
thread of that tradition, which connected the Natchez
with the Aztecs, of whom beyond all doubt
they were an abrasion. Had he done so, the light
his meditative mind would have thrown on the traditions
of that mysterious people, of whom now no
remnant exists, and the memory of whom is forgotten,
can scarcely be calculated. His poetical meditations
did not, however, prevent him from keeping
in view the original idea which had brought him to
America, and he became more and more resolved to
penetrate to the icy Pole. One day though, by a
strange fancy, a fragment of a French paper, containing
an account of the flight of Louis XVI, his
arrest at Varennes, and the formation of the Army
of Condé, beyond the Rhine, reached him. As he
read this strange intelligence, the Breton gentleman,
fancied that he heard the cry of honor calling him
to defend that king for whom he had sworn to live
and die. He then hastened, to cross the sea again,
and within a few months, was a simple volunteer in
the ranks of the royal and catholic army. It is
well, here, to mention, that though Chateaubriand
sought for the North Pole, he had from the lakes of
New York, gone southward, and that the fragment
of newspaper, which, in all probability, changed the
tenor of his whole career, reached him in the depth
of the lagoons of Florida. It is very certain that
though his voyage to America, produced Atala and
the Natches, he would not have occupied a high position
among the great discoverers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having been wounded by the explosion of a shell,
at Thionville, after undergoing the greatest vicissitudes,
he contrived to reach England. The danger
from which he had escaped on the Rhine, was,
however, replaced only by penury, and the suffering
of exile. In that country while expecting death,
his physicians having told him, that he could live,
under no possibility, more than two or three years,
he wrote and published the “<span class='it'>Essai historique,
politique et moral, sur <a id='les'></a>les révolutions anciennes
et modernes considérées dans leurs rapports avec</span>
<span class='it'>la révolution Française</span>.” This is one of the strangest
books ever published, the author succeeding in
the most incomprehensible manner in drawing a
parallel between Pisistratus and <span class='it'>Robespierre</span>, <span class='it'>Marat</span>
and Harmodius, <span class='it'>J. J. Rousseau</span> and Heraclitus,
Hanno and Fox, and Barca and Pitt, and finally discovering
in Miltiades the type of Dumouriez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having on the 18th Brumaire returned to France,
Chateaubriand became with Fontanes, his friend, a
companion in exile, one of the proprietors of the
<span class='it'>Mercure</span>, in which paper he published Atala, (so far
back as this does the French <span class='it'>feuilleton</span> date.) The
freshness of the ideas, the grandeur of sentiment, and
exquisitely simple style of this book, were novel indeed,
at a time when all things were innoculated
with the pretence of the Directorate. The success
of this prose-poem aptly prepared the public for the
immense sensation subsequently created by <span class='it'>le genie
du Christianisme</span>. It may safely be said that no
work was ever better timed. The iron grasp of Napoleon
had strangled all popular movements, order
had succeeded anarchy, temples again were open for
prayer, and ruined altars were rebuilt. All the world,
weary of the fruitless worship of the personification
of abstract and transcendental qualities and virtues,
felt an innate longing for a less sterile and more
poetical faith. Society hastened to resume that old
creed, which had been the source of all the civilization
which existed, not it may be true, because of
conviction, but because the disgusting orgies at the
feet of the statue of the so-called goddess of reason,
had offended not only all sentiment but all decency.
Never probably before were the fasts and feasts of
Christianity so rigidly observed, and all France, by
a rigid observance of Lent, sought to atone for and
wipe out all remembrance of the reign of terror.
With that wonderful sagacity which made Napoleon
great in cabinet as he was on the battle-field,
he did not neglect Chateaubriand’s book, and rewarded
the author by the appointment of Secretary
of Embassy to Rome, where the Cardinal Fesch
was the French representative. Then, in the eternal
city, amid the ruins of the coliseum, yet filled
with the spirits of the ancient martyrs, the Christian
poet formed a conception of the angelical Cymodocré
and Eudoxe, and determined to visit the cradle
of Christianity, the triumph and contests of which
he resolved to celebrate, and to gather inspiration in
the “city of desolation” by contemplating that one
sepulchre which when time shall be no more will
yield nothing to the great, grand judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after his return from Rome, the Vicomte de
Chateaubriand, who continued to maintain as high a
position as ever in the favor of Napoleon, was appointed
plenipotentiary to the Valois. Just then a
rumor, circulated beyond doubt by the partisans of
the exiled dynasty, acquired some influence on the
popular mind, many hoping and others fearing that
the emperor was prepared to follow the example of
Monk, and sought to replace the Bourbons on the
throne of Saint Louis and Henri IV. Chateaubriand,
perhaps more than any one else, under the influence
of the chivalric ideas which always characterised
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
him, flattered himself that this dream would soon be
realised. At once, however, all Paris was amazed
by the news that the Duke d’Enghien, the last of the
Condés, had been shot at midnight, in the ditch of
the castle of Vincennes. Thus Napoleon replied to
the imprudent suggestions of the royalists. The
reason of this terrible tragedy is even now unknown,
the only man who possibly could have explained it,
the emperor, having borne the secret with him to the
grave. The whole party then known as the emigration,
was however terrified, and under the influence
of a generous indignation, on the very day
that he heard the news Chateaubriand resigned his
appointment. Independence was then a crime, but
far from being offended, Napoleon conceived a yet
more exalted esteem for Chateaubriand. Prayers,
promises, every possible inducement were used in
vain to retain him in the imperial service. Chateaubriand
hurried the preparations for his pilgrimage
and crossed the Alps. On his previous visit
he had not studied closely enough the Italian, and
after a careful tour the vicomte sailed for Greece.
In the wilds of America, the poet had shaken himself
free of all old-world ideas as he would from
a burden which oppressed him, that his soul in
vigor, and unrestrained, might hear every accent of
the poetry of a young nature. In Greece, however,
his conduct was precisely the reverse. He was in
the holy land of poetry and art, and he sought to conjure
up by the powerful magic of memory, the mighty
dead who for almost twenty centuries have slumbered
in unknown graves. Thrice, according to ancient
usage, he made the echos of Thermopylæ
resound with the name of Leonidas, and in his pious
wanderings across the ruins of Athens, he would
ascend some fallen tribune, from which perhaps the
voice of Demosthenes might have been heard moving
the popular mind as the wind agitates the sea, and
calling forth a new generation of warriors by the
magic of the names of “those who died at Marathon.”
If ever a man was instinct with the feeling of
universal love, if ever any one idolized nature it was
Chateaubriand, the piety of whom, however, was too
intense to permit him ever to mistake the apparent
for the great first cause. In the words of one of our
own writers “he was filled with devotion to God
and sympathized with all humanity.” Those now
desolate regions he soon left, and the enthusiast
went to seek in the dwelling-places of the once “people
of God,” those spots over which Christ had
passed during his pilgrimage from Bethlehem to the
“place of the skull,” amid hordes of savage Bedweens
and robber Arabs, he crossed the summits of
Mount Liban and the waters of the sea of death. He
prayed on the Mount of Olives, moistened his lip in
the cool wave of the Jordan, and brought a portion
of its waters, which, preserved with all the care of a
pious superstition was subsequently used at the baptism
of the Duke of <a id='bord'></a>Bordeaux. He finally knelt at
the very tomb of Christ, the venerable guardians of
which clasped on his heel the spur of Godfry de
Bouillon, and made him a “Knight of the Holy Sepulchre.”
The city of Alexandria and the capital of
the Ptolemies were also visited by him, and ascending
the Nile as far as Cairo, he sat at the foot of the
pyramids, and gave himself up to meditation amid
the Memphian ruins. He then re-embarked, and
after undergoing imminent danger from shipwreck,
landed at Tunis. Neglecting the living city, he
visited that Carthage which twice became the rival
of Rome, in war in the days of Hannibal, and in religion
when St. Cyprian lived. From Africa Chateaubriand
passed to Spain, that land of war and love,
and as he wandered through the dilapidated halls of
the Alhambra, and recalled Pelayo, Charlemagne
and Boabdil, he formed the conception of the
tender and chivalric legend of “<span class='sc'>The Last Abencerrages</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return to Spain, in 1807, Chateaubriand,
who had not yet ceased to feel an interest in Spain,
published an analysis of Laborde’s book on that
country. This book excited great curiosity, some of
the pages containing allusions to which a malicious
public gave a point. Napoleon was weak enough to
take offense at a fancied parallel between himself and
Nero; and after having stripped him of his ownership
of the <a id='mer'></a><span class='it'>Mercure</span>, went so far as to threaten to
have him shot down in the Tuileries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The independence of Chateaubriand is well known,
and the despotism of Napoleon found an untiring
enemy in him. All were, however, surprised to find
in his <span class='it'>Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem</span>, frequent
eulogies of the imperial glory. The public was not
aware of the fact, that a few days before its appearance,
the publisher was notified that it would be
suppressed unless praises of the emperor were inserted.
Chateaubriand long protested against this
edict, and yielded only to the prayers of the bookseller,
who informed him that the suppression of the
work would be his ruin. He had, however, something
in reserve to gratify his self-respect, speaking
only of the military glory, not of the statesman-like
qualities of Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequently, in his peaceful hermitage of <span class='it'>la vallée
aux loups</span>, Chateaubriand finished the great work,
the plan of which he had conceived at Rome, and
which he had meditated on during the whole of his pilgrimage
in Greece, Judea, and Africa. <span class='it'>The Martyrs</span>
at last appeared, and were all the pamphlets and
books of every size which it called forth collected,
a hall large as the Alexandrine Library would not
suffice to contain them. It was a daring act, indeed,
to personify, in a prose-poem, all the mysterious
powers of Christianity. It was a poetical novel, the
old gods of Greece and Rome playing a conspicuous
part. In the introduction of the Pagan divinities,
instead of Beelzebub and the powers of darkness,
does this book greatly differ in general conception
from the strange old book of the Puritan Bunyan.
The genius of Christianity, however, demonstrates
that there was inherent in Christianity, not less
poetry than existed in the Heathen Olympus, and
that the mysteries of Christianity opened as rich a
field to the poet as did the Hesiodic theogony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a great discovery in France, where at
that time the Paradise Lost, and Klopstock’s great
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
poem, were almost unknown. The attack and defense
of this poem consequently created much excitement,
and the reputation of Chateaubriand rapidly
expanded. In 1811, a chair in the Academy having,
by the death of Joseph Chenier, become vacant,
public opinion designated Chateaubriand as the person
most qualified to fill it. It is well known that
custom requires the new member to eulogize his
predecessor. Chateaubriand, however, in politics
differed entirely from Chenier, and unwilling to
submit to the usage, had prepared to attack him.
The emperor having heard of his intention, forbade
him to pronounce his address, seeing that
this could not but be a dangerous precedent at a time
when the judges of Louis XIV. occupied all the
principal offices of state. From that time the emperor
and Chateaubriand were irreconcilable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the hundred days Chateaubriand accompanied
Louis XVIII. to Ghent, and after the restoration,
was elevated to the dignity of a peer of France.
At this crisis his opinions were ultra royalist. In his
last work, <span class='it'>de la Monarchie selon la Charte</span>, he
dared to define clearly the position of the king, according
to the charter; he lost favor, Louis XVIII.
being too shrewd to break with the liberal party.
The order dismissing him is very significative, viz.,
“The Vicomte de Chateaubriand having in a printed
book expressed doubt in relation to our personal will,
made known in the decree of the 5th of September,
the said Vicomte will, from to-day, cease to be one
of our ministers of state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now scarcely worth while to follow Chateaubriand
through all the phases of his political life.
Dismissed and subsequently restored to royal favor,
he was ambassador at both Berlin and London. He
was also plenipotentiary at the Congress at Verona,
again dismissed, and sent as minister to Rome. He
again resigned on the coming into power of the
ministry of Polignac, and even then foresaw the fall
of the throne he had been so anxious to make secure.
Having undergone proscription and exile, he had nothing
more to undergo except imprisonment. He
was yet doomed to taste of prison-fare, and it was
reserved for the government of Louis Philippe to
arraign the author of <span class='it'>The Martyrs</span> before the Court
of Assizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequent to the restoration, besides various
political pamphlets, Chateaubriand published many
works of a purely literary character. The first of
these was <span class='it'>The Natchez</span>. The manuscript of this
book, forgotten with many other similar things by
the author, had been left at an inn in London, on the
occasion of his return from emigration after the 18th
Brumaire. Twenty years after it was strangely recovered
in a cottage at an obscure village. The
honesty of persons to whom he had confided it was
the source of one of the happiest hours of the life of
Chateaubriand, and secured to the world one of the
<span class='it'>chef-d’œuvres</span> of romance. Next came Moses, the
Essay on English Poetry, the translation of Milton,
the Congress of Verona, and the Life of <span class='it'>Ranée</span>.
The life of Chateaubriand, it will be seen, was
eventful as the age in which he lived. Like Dante,
Tasso, Cervantes, Camaeus, and Milton, persecution
of every kind was heaped on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years he lived in an almost impenetrable
retirement. Caring little for the convulsions
of the world, or for courtly intrigues, he has consecrated
his time to the publication of his <span class='it'>Memoires
d’Outre Tombe</span>, the recent publication of which has
suggested this notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remarkable book he thus prefaces: “I have
met almost all the men who, in my own days, have
been conspicuous in my own or foreign countries—Washington
and Napoleon, Louis XVIII. and Popes
Alexander, Pius VII., and Gregory XVI., Fox, Pitt,
Sheridan, Londonderry, Capo d’Istrias, Malesherbes,
and Mirabeau, Nelson, Bolivar, Mehemet, the Pacha
of Egypt, Suffren, Bougainville, Lapeyrouse, Moreau,
and others. I was one of a triumverate which has
no parallel in the history of the world; three poets
of different views and interests having been almost
at the same time ministers of foreign affairs—I, in
France, Canning, in England, and Martinez de la
Rosa, in Spain, I have lived through the uneventful
years of my youth, the teeming era of the republic,
the proud days of Buonaparte, and the reign of legitimacy.
I have sailed over the seas of the Old and
New World, and stood on the soils of four quarters
of the globe. I have slept in the Indian wigwam,
Arab tent, and Huron hut; amid the ruins of Athens,
Jerusalem, Memphis, Carthage, and Grenada, with
the Greek, Turk, and Moor, amid forests, and amid
deserted cities. I have worn a bear-skin cap, and
the Mameluke caftan; I have undergone hunger and
thirst, and as an ambassador, covered with golden
embroidery, and stars, and insignia of chivalry, have
sat at the board of kings, princesses and ladies, and
then have again become impoverished, and have
languished in prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time the health of Chateaubriand had
been the source of much uneasiness to his friends,
but on his return from a trip to Dieppe, in 1847, the
symptoms became absolutely alarming. He had resolved
to visit Italy, but was attacked with pneumonia,
in Paris, and died July 4, 1848, after an illness
of five days. The body of the poet was taken
to Saint Malo, his birth-place, and on a rocky promontory,
where the waves of the Atlantic ceaselessly
beat, one who was restless as they, found a
final repose. Full of tender love for his childhood’s
home, he himself selected his burial place, as the
bird which perchance has girded the earth, returns
to the nest whence it first winged its flight—to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor young creature, how perfectly wretched she
looks as she sits in the bow-window, watching the
fairy-like thistle-seed as it goes floating away up in
the still air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing like these clear September nights
after sunset, for a reverie. If it is a calm evening,
and an intense light fills the sky and glorifies it, and
you sit where you can see the new moon, with the
magnificent evening star beneath it, you must be a
stupid affair indeed, if you cannot then dream the
most <span class='it'>heavenly</span> dreams!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rosalie Sherwood is in no dreaming mood
this lovely Sabbath night. Her heart is crushed in
such an utter hopelessness of grief as leaves no room
in it for hopes, her brain is too acutely sensitive just
now for visions. The thistle-down in beautiful procession
moves gently on and up before her eyes, and
as she watches, the frail things assume a new interest
to her; she feels a human sympathy with them—like
the viewless winds they come, from whence
she knows not—and go, whither none can tell. They
are homeless and alone, and she is like them, but
she is not, as they, purposeless!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you could look into her mind now, you would
see how she has nerved it up to a great determination—how,
that mastering visions and hopes once
cherished, she has gone forward now to a bleak and
barren path, and stands there very resolute, yet, in
the first moment of the resolve, miserable; no—she
has not yet grown strong in the suffering—she cannot
<span class='it'>this</span> night stand up beneath the burden, to bear
it with a smile of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosalie Sherwood was an only child: the infant
of an humble friend Mrs. Melville had known from
her own girlhood. She, poor creature, had neither
<span class='it'>lived</span> nor <span class='it'>died</span> a sinner,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;By man is cursed alway!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On her death-bed Cecily Sherwood gave her unrecognized,
nameless child, to the care of one who
promised, in the sincerity of her compassion, to be a
mother to the unfortunate infant. And during the
eighteen years of that girl’s life, from the hour of her
mother’s death, to the day when she was left without
hope in the world, Rosalie <span class='it'>had</span> found a parent
in the rigid but always just and kind, Mary Melville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This widow lady had one son; he was four years
old when her husband died, which was the very year
that the little Rosalie was brought to Melville House.
The boy’s father had been considered a man of large
wealth, but when his affairs were settled after his
decease, it was found that the debts of the estate
being paid, little more than a competency remained
for the widow. But the lady was fitted, by a life of
self-discipline, even in her luxurious home, to calmly
meet this emergency. With the remnant of a great
fortune she retired to an humble residence, where in
quiet retirement she gave her time to managing the
household affairs, and to superintending the home-education
of her children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her son Duncan, and the young Rosalie had grown
up together—until the girl’s twelfth birth-day constant
playmates and pupils in the same academy.
No one, not even the busiest busy-body had ever
been able to detect the slightest partiality in Mrs.
Melville’s treatment of her children. And indeed it
had been quite impossible that she should ever regard
a child so winningly beautiful as Rosalie, with
other than the tenderest affection. Under a light or
careless rein, the child had been a difficult one to
manage, for there was a light like fire oft-times in
her eyes that told of strong will, and deep passions;
and besides, her striking appearance had won sufficient
admiration to have completely spoiled her, if
a guardian the most vigilant, as well as most discerning,
had not been ever at hand to speak the right
word and do the right thing with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Melville was a thoroughly religious woman,
and deeply conscious of the responsibility she incurred
in adopting the infant. She could not quiet her
conscience with the reflection that she had done a
wonderfully good thing in giving Rosalie a home
and education—the deep pity she felt for the unfortunate
child led her to exercise an uncommon care,
that all tendency to evil should be eradicated in the
heart of the brilliant girl while she was yet young—that
a deep sense of right should be impressed on her
tender mind. And her labor of love met with a return
which might well have made the mother
proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been no officious voice to whisper to
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
Rosalie Sherwood the story of that doubtful position
which she occupied in the world. She was an orphan,
the adopted child of the lady whom she so devoutly
loved, with all a daughter’s tenderness, this she
knew, and it was all she knew—and Mrs. Melville
was resolved that she should never know more.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>The son of the widow had been educated for the
ministry. He was now twenty-two years old, and
was soon to be admitted to the priesthood. This was
following out his own wish, and the dearest hope of
his mother’s heart—and it seemed to all who knew
the young man as though the Head of the Church
had set His seal upon Duncan from his boyhood. He
was so mild and so forbearing—so discreet and generous,
and never deaf to <span class='it'>any</span> call of charity. Meek
and holy of heart, was the thought of whosoever
looked on his placid, youthful face. Yet he had besides
his gentleness, that, without which his spirit
might have subsided into puerile weakness, a firmness
of purpose and a strict sense of right, like that
which marked his mother among women. Duncan
Melville’s abilities were of a high order, perhaps not
of the highest—though, if his ambition would only
equal his powers, they would surely seem so. His
voice was of a sweet, persuasive tone, that was fitted
to <span class='it'>win</span> souls to Christ, yet it could ring like a clarion
when the grandeur of the themes he touched fired
his own soul. He had moreover an earnest, impressive
manner, even in private conversation, which
characterized all his words and deeds. With the
warmest hopes and deepest interest they who knew
the difficulties and trials of the profession he had
chosen looked on this young man.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>Duncan and his adopted sister had long known the
nature of the tie which bound them members of one
family, and they never called themselves brother and
sister after the youth came home, a graduate from
college. For, from the time when absence empowered
him to look, as a stranger would on Rosalie,
from that time he saw her elegant, and accomplished,
and bewitching as she was, and other than
fraternal affection was in his heart for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Rosalie, too, loved him—just as Duncan, had he
spoken his passion and his hope, would have prayed
her to love him. She had long ago made him the
standard of all manly excellence, and when he came
back after three years of absence, she was not inclined
to revoke her early decision—therefore was
she prepared to read the language of Duncan’s eyes,
and she consecrated her heart to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the years which followed his return from
college, till he was prepared for ordination as a priest,
he did not once <span class='it'>speak</span> to her of his love, which was
growing all the while stronger and deeper, as the
river-course, that, flowing to the ocean, receives
every day fresh impetus and force from the many
tiny springs that commingle with it. Duncan Melville
never thought of wedding with another than
Rosalie Sherwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, as I said, near the time appointed for his
ordination, when he felt for the first time, as though
he had <span class='it'>a right</span> to speak openly with her of all his
hopes. He asked her then, what in soul-language
he had long before asked, a question which she had
as emphatically, in like language, answered—to be
the partner of his life for weal or for wo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had tried to calmly consider Rosalie’s character,
as a Christian minister should consider the character
of her whom he would make the sharer of his
peculiar lot, and setting every preference aside, Duncan
felt that she was fitted to assist and to bear, with
him. She was truthful as the day, strong-minded
and generous, humane and charitable, and though no
professor of religion, a woman full of reverence and
veneration. He knew that it was only a fear that
she should not <span class='it'>adorn</span> the Christian name that kept
her back from the altar of the church, and he loved
her for that spirit of humility, knowing that she was
“on the Lord’s side,” and that grace ere long would
be given her to proclaim it in the doing <span class='it'>all</span> His commandments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly with a joyful and confident heart,
after he had <span class='it'>spoken</span> with Rosalie, that Duncan
sought his mother yesterday, to speak with her of the
<span class='it'>whole</span> of that bright future which opened now before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How then was he overcome with surprise and
grief, when Mrs. Melville told him that it was a union
to which she could <span class='it'>never</span> consent! Then, for the
first time in his life, the astonished young man heard
of that stain which was on the name poor Rosalie
bore. He heard the story to an end, and then with a
decision and energy that would have settled the matter
with almost any other person, he declared:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, mother—I will not give her up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It could not be expected that you would fulfill the
engagement; Rosalie herself would not allow it, if
she knew the truth of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she need not know it—there is no existing
necessity. Is it not enough that she is good and precious
<span class='it'>to me</span>? She is a noble woman, whose life has
been, thanks to your guidance, beautiful and lofty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows I have striven to do my duty by her—but
I know not what I should have done, if I had
thought you would ever wish to change your relations
with her, Duncan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world has not her equal! It is cruel, it is
wrong, mother, in you to oppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She <span class='it'>is</span> a lovely woman—she has well availed
herself of the advantages given her—but, my son,
there are myriads like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not one! Tell me, you will never breathe
a word of this to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you! thank you! Mother, you could
not wish another daughter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for that I have told you, Duncan, I could not
wish another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I say you must not work this great injustice
on her and me. Rosalie loves me, she has promised
to be mine. You will break my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are deluded and strangely excited, my son,
or you never would speak so to me,” said the mother,
persisting in that firmness with which the physician
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
resorts to a desperate remedy for a desperate
disease. Then she spoke to him of all the relations
in life he might yet be called upon to assume, of the
misery which very possibly might follow, though
now unforeseen, in after days—hours passed on, and
the conference was not ended until with a crushed
heart and trembling voice Duncan arose abruptly,
while his mother yet spoke, and he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the conclusion to which you have urged me is
right in God’s sight, He will give me, He will give
Rosalie, too, strength to abide by it. But I can never
speak to her of this, and I must find another home
than yours and hers. You must speak <span class='it'>for</span> me, mother—and
oh let me charge you, do it gently. Do
not tell her <span class='it'>all</span>. Let her think what she will—believe,
as she must, that I am a wretch past pardon,
but do not blight her peace by telling <span class='it'>all</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise you, Duncan,” was the answer, spoken
through many tears, and the young man did not wait
to hear more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour after he was on the way from the village,
that he might spend the coming Sabbath in another
town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after he was gone the mother sought her
younger, her dearly-loved child. Rosalie heard that
familiar step on the stairway—she had seen Duncan
hurrying away from the house, and she knew the
conference was over: but she had no fear for its result.
So she hushed the glad, tumultuous beating of
her heart, and tried to veil the brightness of her eyes,
as she heard the gentle tapping at her door that announced
the mother coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mrs. Melville—<span class='it'>her</span> heart quite failed her
when she went into the pleasant room and sat down
close by Rosalie. Despite all the strengthening
thoughts of duty she had taken with her as a support
in that interview, she was now at a sore loss, for it
was a bitter grief to her kind heart that she must
even for a day make those young creatures unhappy.
How then could she endure to take away their life’s
best joy, their richest hope? It was a hard thing—and
many moments passed before she could nerve
that strong spirit to utter the first word; and Rosalie,
anxious, and impatient too, but unsuspecting, at last
exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can it be that so much troubles you, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mary Melville spoke, but in a voice so soft
and sad, and so faint with emotion, that it seemed
not at all <span class='it'>her</span> voice—she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to consider that what I say to you,
dear child, has given me more pain even to think
of, than I have ever felt before. Duncan has told me
of your engagement to marry with him. And it has
been my duty, my most sorrowful duty, oh believe
me! to tell him that such a tie can never unite you.
He can never be your husband, you can never be his
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused, exhausted by her emotion—she could
not utter another syllable. Rosalie who had watched
her with a fixed astonishment as she listened to the
words, was the first to speak again, and she tried to
say calmly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you have a reason for saying so. It is
but just that I should know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot <span class='it'>be</span> known. If I had ever in my life deceived
you, Rosalie, you might doubt me now when
I assure you, that an impediment which cannot be
named, exists to the marriage. Have I not been a
mother to you always?” she asked appealingly, imploringly,
“I love you as I love Duncan—and it cuts
me to the heart to grieve you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Duncan given you an answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has trusted to his mother,” she said, almost
proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather than me,” quickly interrupted Rosalie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather than do that which is wrong; which
might prove the misery of you both hereafter, my
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he? Why does he not come himself
to tell me this? If the thing is really true, <span class='it'>his</span> lips
should have spoken it and not another’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could not do it. I believe his heart is broken.
Oh, Rosalie, do not look so upon me. Is it not
enough that I bitterly regret, that I shall always deplore
having not <a id='fore'></a>foreseen the result of your companionship.
Say only that you do believe I have
striven to do the best for you always, so far as I
knew how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven knows that I believe it, mother. When
will Duncan come home again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monday, not before.”</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>When Monday morning came, on the desk in Rosalie’s
room this letter was found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot leave you forever, Duncan, I cannot go
from your protecting care, mother, without saying
all that is in my heart. I have no strength to look
on you, my brother, again—mother, the union I had
thought between <span class='it'>us</span> life-lasting, is broken. I cannot
any longer be your daughter. I would have done so,
I would have remained in any capacity, as a slave
even, in your service, for I was bound by gratitude
for all you have done for me, to be with you always,
at least, so long as you should wish. If you had unveiled
the mystery, and suffered me to stand before
you, recognizing myself as <span class='it'>you</span> knew me, I would
have stayed—I would have been to you, Duncan, as
in childhood, a proud, yet humble sister, rejoicing in
your triumphs—and a sharer in your sorrows. I
would have put fetters on my heart, and calmed my
voice, and veiled my eyes, the spirit dwelling in
me should have been henceforth a stranger to you.
I would have borne to see another made your wife—but
in a mistaken kindness you put this utterly beyond
my power. Too much has been required—and,
I am found—wanting! If even the most miserable
fate that can befall an innocent woman, if the
curse of illegitimacy were upon me, I could bear that
thought even, and acknowledge <span class='it'>the</span> justice and wisdom
that did not consider me fit to associate with
those, whose birth is recognized by a parent’s pride
and fondness. But—I must be cognizant of the relation,
whatever it is, that I bear you. I cannot, I
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
will not consent to appear nominally your daughter,
when you scorn to receive me as such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother—in my dead mother’s name I thank you
for the generous love you have ever shown me—for
the generous care with which you have attended to
the development of the talents God gave me. For I
am fitted thus to labor for myself. I thank you for
that watchful providence that has made me what I
am, a woman self-reliant, and strong in spirit. I
thank you for it all, from a heart that has learned
only to love and honor you in the past eighteen years.
And I call down the blessing of the Infinite God upon
you, as I depart. Hereafter, always it will be the
endeavor of my life to live worthily of you—to be all
that you have in your charity capacitated me to be.
Duncan, you will not forget me—I do not ask it.
But, pray for me, and live up to the fullness of your
heart and your intellect. There is a happy future
for you. I have no word of counsel, no feeble utterance
of encouragement to leave you—you will not
need such from <span class='it'>me</span>. God bless and strengthen you
in every good word and work—it shall be the constant
hope of the sister who <span class='it'>loves</span> you. Mother, fare
you well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This letter was written on that Sabbath-eve, on
which our story opens—written in a perfect passion,
yes, of grief, and of despair. The anger that Rosalie
may at first have felt, gave way to the wildest
sorrow now, but her resolution was taken, and her
heart was really strung to bear the resolution out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her sudden and most unlooked-for disappearance,
the mother and son sought long, and I
cannot tell, you must imagine how anxiously, for
the young girl. But their search was in vain, and
at last, as time passed on, she became to the villagers
as one who had never been. But never by the
widow was Rosalie forgotten. And oh! there was
in the world one heart at least that sorrowed with a
constant sorrow, that hoped with a constant hope
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had lost her—and Duncan sought for no other
love among women. When all his searching for
Rosalie was proved to be unavailing, the minister
applied himself with constant industry to his profession—he
forgot ease and comfort, and personal
enjoyment, in the works of his calling. And verily,
he met here with his reward, for as he was a blessing
to the people of his parish, in turn they almost
adored him. He was a spiritual physician, whom
God empowered to heal many a wounded, stricken
heart; but there was a cross of suffering, that he
bore himself, which could not <span class='it'>be</span> removed: It was
his glory, that he bore it with martyr-like patience;
that he never uttered a reproachful word to her,
through whom he bore it. As years passed away,
the gifted preacher’s impassioned eloquence and
stirring words, bowed many a proud and impenitent
soul, with another love than that which he
wished to inspire, but he still sought not among any
companionship, or close friendship; they said at last,
considering his life spent in the most rigid performance
of duty, that “he was too high church to
marry;” that he did not believe such union consonant
with the duties of a minister of the cross!—But,
the mother knew better than this; <span class='it'>she</span> knew a
name that was never spoken now, in Rosalie’s old
home, that was dearer than life to the heart of her
son—and desolate and lonely as she was, she never
<span class='it'>dared</span> ask him to give to her a daughter—to take
unto himself a wife!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In a splendid old cathedral, a solemn ceremonial
was going forward on the morning of a holy festival.
A bishop was to be consecrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mighty crowd assembled in this edifice to witness
the ceremony, and the mother of Duncan Melville
was there, the happiest soul in all that great
company, for it was her son on whom the high honor
was to be laid!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How beautiful was the pale, holy countenance of
the minister, who in the early strength of his manhood,
was accounted worthy to fill that great office,
for which he was about to be set apart! He was a
man “acquainted with grief;” you had known it by
that resigned, submissive expression of his face:
you had known that the passions of mortals had
been all subdued in him, by the holy light of his tranquil
eyes. Duncan <span class='it'>had</span> toiled—he <span class='it'>had</span> borne a
burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thousand felt it, looking on the noble front,
where religion undefiled, and peace, and holy love,
and charity, had left for themselves unmistakable
witnesses: and more than all, one being felt it, that
had not looked upon that man for years. Not since
the lines of care and grief had marked the face and
form of Duncan Melville. There was a reason for the
passionate sobs of one heart, crushed anew in this
solemn hour—there was a pathos, such as no other
voice could give, to the prayers that went up to God
that day, from one woman’s heart in the great congregation,
for <span class='it'>him</span>. Poor, loving, still-beloved Rosalie!
she was there—there, her proud, magnificent
figure, bent humbly from the very commencement
till the close of the ceremonial—there, her beautiful
eyes filled with tears of love, and grief, and despair,
and pride—there, crushed as the humblest flower—that
glorious beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the good man at the altar for whom the prayers
and the praise ascended, thought of her in that
hour! Yes, in that very hour, he remembered how
one would have looked on him that day, could she
have come, his wife, to witness how his brethren
and the people loved and honored him. He thought
of her, and as he knelt at the altar, even then he
prayed for her. But, not as numbers thought upon
the name of Rosalie Sherwood that day; for she
also, was soon to appear before a throng, and there
were a myriad hearts that throbbed with expectancy,
and waited impatiently for the hour to come
when they should look upon her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Melville sat in his study at noonday, for
a few moments, alone. He was glancing over the
sermon that he was to deliver that afternoon, when
his mother, his proud, happy mother came into the
room quietly, laid a sealed note upon the table, and
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
instantly withdrew, for she saw how he was occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished his reading, the bishop
opened the note and read—could it have been with
careless eyes?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Duncan</span>,—I have knelt to-day in the house of the
Lord, and witnessed your triumph. Ten years ago
when I went desolate and wretched from your house,
I might have <a id='pro'></a>prophesied your destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to-night and behold <span class='it'>my</span> triumph—at—the
Opera House!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>“Your sister,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“<span class='sc'>Rosalie</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you think that as he read that summons he
hesitated as to whether he should obey it? If his
bishopric had been sacrificed therefor, he would have
gone—if disgrace and danger had attended his footsteps,
he would have sought her at the bidding!—The
love which had been strengthening in ten long
years of loneliness and bereavement, was not now
to stop, to question, or to fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accompany me dear mother, this evening—I
have made an engagement for you,” he said as he
went, she hanging on his arm, to the cathedral for
afternoon service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willingly my son,” was the instant answer: and
Duncan kept her to her word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was with wondering, with surprise, that
she did not attempt to conceal, and with questions
which were satisfied with no definite reply, that
Mrs. Melville found herself standing with her son
in an obscure corner of the Opera-House, that night.
Soon all her expressions of astonishment were hushed,
but by another cause than the mysterious inattention
of her son—a queenly woman appeared upon
the stage, she lifted her voice and sobbed the mournful
wail, which opens the first scene in —— ——.
For years, there had not been such a sensation created
among the frequenters of that place as now, by
the appearance of this stranger. The wild, singular
style of her beauty, made an impression, that was
heightened by every movement of her graceful
figure, every tone of her rich, melodious voice.—She
seemed, for the time, the very embodiment of
the sorrow, to which she gave expression, and the
effect was a complete triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Melville and her son gazed upon the debutant,
they had no look no word for each other; for
they recognized in her voice, the tones of a grief,
of which long ago they heard the prelude, and
every note found its echo in the bishop’s inmost
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come away! let us go home! Duncan, this is
no place for us, for <span class='it'>you</span>; it is disgrace to be here,”
was the passionate plea of the mother, when at last,
Rosalie disappeared, and other forms stood in her
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will stay and save her,” was the answer
spoken with tears and trembling, by the man for
whom, in many a quiet home, prayers in that hour
ascended. “She is mine <span class='it'>now</span>, and no earthly consideration
or power shall divide us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And looking steadfastly for a moment in her son’s
face, the lady turned away sighing and tearful, for
she knew that she must yield then, and she had fears
for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hour passed, and the star of the night
re-appeared—resplendent in beauty, and triumphing
in hope—again her marvelous voice was raised,
not with the wail of sorrow—not with the bitter cry
of despair that was hopeless, but glad, and gay,
angelic in its joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the mother’s eyes were turned on him
beside her—and a light was on that pale forehead,
a smile on that calm face, a gladness in those eyes,
which she had not seen there for long years,—and
though she could not wonder as she looked with a
mother’s love upon the one, who stood the admiration
of all eyes, crowned with the glory-crown of
perfection in her art; she could not with Duncan,
hope. For, alas! her woman heart knew too well,
the ordeal through which the daughter of her care
and love must have passed, before she came into
<span class='it'>that</span> presence, where she stood now—who could tell
if still the mistress of herself, and of her destiny,
pure and undefiled?</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>That night and the following day, there were
many who sought admittance to the parlors of Rosalie
Sherwood; they would lay the homage of their
trifling hearts at her feet. But all these sought in
vain—and why was this? Because such admiring
tribute was not what the noble woman sought, and
because, ere she had risen in the morning, a letter
written in the solitude of night, was handed her,
which barred and bolted her door against the curious
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosalie! Rosalie! look back through the ten
years that are gone, I am answering your letter of
long ago, with words—I have a thousand times answered
them in my heart, till the thoughts which
have been crowded there filled it almost to breaking.
We have met, met at last, you and I. But,
did you call that a triumph, when you stood in God’s
house, and saw them lay their consecrating hands
upon me? Heaven forgive me, I was thinking of
<span class='it'>you</span> then—and thinking too, that if this honor was
in any way to be thought a reward, the needful part
of it was wanting—you were not there! Yet, you
<span class='it'>were</span> there, you have written me—ah, but not <span class='it'>Rosalie
my wife</span>, the woman I loved better than <span class='it'>all</span> on earth,
the <span class='it'>acknowledged</span> woman, whose memory I had
borne about with me till it was a needful part of my
existence. You were by when the people came to
see me consecrated:—and I obeyed <span class='it'>your</span> call, I saw
you, when the people anointed you with the tears
of their admiration and praise. If you read my
heart at all that day, you knew how I had suffered,
that I had grown old in the sorrow; was I mistaken
to-night, in the thought that you too were not unmindful
of the past—that you were not <span class='it'>satisfied</span>
with the popular applause? that you also, have been
lonely, and wept and sorrowed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is but one barrier now in the wide world
that shall interpose between us, Rosalie—your own
will. If I was ever anything to you, I beseech you
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
think calmly before you answer, and do not let your
‘triumph’ to-night, blind you to the fact, which you
once recognized—which can make us happy <span class='it'>yet</span>.—I
trust you as in our younger days; nothing, nothing
but your own words, could convince me that you
are not worthy to take the highest place among the
ladies of this land:—give me only your heart—and
let the remembrance that I have been faithful to you
through all the past, plead for me, if your pride
should rise up to condemn me. Let me come and
plead <span class='it'>with</span> you, for I know not what I write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer returned to this letter was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I learned long ago the bar that prevented our
union—it is in existence still, Duncan. Your mother
only, shall decide, if it be insurmountable. I have
never, for a moment, doubted your faithfulness, and
it has been to me an unspeakable comfort, in the
days when I was alone, and toiling for a support, to
know that none had supplanted me in your affections.
In the temptations, and struggles, and hardships
I have known, it has kept me above and beyond
the world—and if the last night’s triumph
proves to be but the opening to a new life for me on
earth, the recollection of what you are, and that you
care for me, will prove a rock of defense, and a
strong-hold of hope, always. Severed from, or
united with you, I am yours forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven days after, there was a marriage in the
little church of that remote village, where Duncan
Melville and Rosalie Sherwood, passed their childhood.
Side by side <a id='they'></a>they stood now, once again,
where the baptismal service had long since been
read for them, and the mother of the bishop gave
the bride away!—“<span class='it'>Honi soit qui mal y pense!</span>”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY REV. J. N. DANFORTH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Genius</span>, in whatever age of the world it has appeared,
has commanded the respect and homage of
mankind. <span class='sc'>Mind</span>, in every stage of development,
and in every altitude of attainment, must be an object
of profound interest to mind. When, therefore,
a mind of so high an order as that of <span class='sc'>John Milton</span>,
appears before men, the fact constitutes an era in
the history of intellect and imagination, and all the
productions of such a mind are scanned and studied
with a diligence proportioned to the dignity and
fame of the author. The principal monument or
statue in honor of the departed, of course attracts
the most profound contemplation, but around it the
genius of the artist may have wrought some beautiful
adjunct figures, worthy of their share of admiration.
Thus, while the Paradise Lost stands in superior
beauty and grandeur, a fitting monument of the
transcendent mind of the author, there are minor
productions of the same imagination, which are
finely conceived, and exquisitely wrought. Among
these may be mentioned <span class='sc'>Comus</span>, a “Mask,” or Dialogue
composed in dramatic form with no particular
attention to rules or probabilities, and therefore
affording the imagination of the poet considerable
freedom in the exercise of its pencil. This was one
of the earliest productions of the muse of Milton,
one in the progress of which he tried the strength of
those pinions, which were destined to bear him beyond
this ‘visible diurnal sphere,’ into those spiritual
and sublime regions, till then unknown to the
adventurous flight of the poet. Johnson, in his
Lives of the Poets, declares this to be “the greatest
of his juvenile performances, in which may very
plainly be discovered the dawn or twilight of Paradise
Lost.” The characters are six only in number,
the Attendant Spirit, Comus and his crew, a Virgin
Lady, her two brothers, and Sabrina, a nymph.—The
scene is a wild-wood, and the poem opens with
a long soliloquy from the attendant spirit, followed
by the entrance of the wizard Comus, and the
strange, unearthly beings of monstrous forms, now
encountered by the lady, who has lost her way in
the woods, and who is subjected to the severe trial
of their foul incantations. The two brothers set
forth in pursuit of their lost sister, and succeed in
finding her, happy that she has survived unharmed,
all the arts of the wicked and the seductive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sabrina, the “goddess of the silver lake,” is invoked,
and rises out of the “cool, translucent wave,”
chiefly to confer a crowning grace upon the scene
and afford further opportunity for the exercise of the
imaginative powers of the poet. There can be said
to be little plan, or intention of plan or plot about the
piece. But whatever may be wanting in beauty or
ingenuity of design, is amply compensated by the
sterling value of the thoughts, the exquisite character
of the imagery, the richness of the coloring, and
the purity of the tone of sentiment. Many a “household
word” is here recognized. Many a stem, from
which we plucked flowers for our herbarium, grew
here. Beautiful gems, that have been set here and
there in the bosom of congenial prose, or, like current
coin, from hand to hand, that have circulated
from mouth to mouth, in elegant society, were formed
in this mine. Those “thousand liveried angels”
that lackey a pure and gentle spirit, the “airy
tongues, that syllable men’s names,” that “charming,
divine philosophy,” which is “musical as
Apollo’s lute,” the vision of those serene and celestial
regions, that glow “above the smoke and stir
of this dim spot, which men call earth,” the view
of a sable cloud, turning its “silver lining on the
night,” these, and many kindred images and sentiments
of beauty, have their original expression in
the Comus, as others do in other works of the immortal
poet, who sought not merely to weave
splendid visions of the imagination, but to embalm
sublime truths for the nourishment of humanity in
all ages, and to vindicate the ways of God to man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, too, we find some of those sententious generics
of history or geography, of fable or fancy;
those classic touches; those suggestive single words,
which instantly bring up before the mind, a train of
ideas, or a treasure of knowledge connected with
the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These habits of thought and composition are fully
developed in Paradise Lost. “The poetry of Milton,”
says an eminent critic, “differs from that of
Dante, as the hieroglyphics of Egypt, differ from
the picture-writing of Mexico. The images which
Dante employs speak for themselves; they stand
simply for what they are. Those of Milton have a
signification which is often discernible only, to the
initiated. Their value depends less on what they
directly represent, than on what they remotely suggest.”
Numerous instances of this might be adduced.
It has been called electrifying the mind
through a conductor. The mind of the reader must
in some good measure co-operate with that of the
author. We must be ready to fill up the outline
which he sketches; to respond with our melody to
the key-note, which he strikes. There must be
some music in the soul that is to appreciate the
genius of Milton. Addison never earned a purer
glory, than when he set forth his merits as by a
charmed pen. Those words of enchantment—those
forms of beauty created by the imagination of the
poet, deeply impressed a congenial mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comus is constructed on the plan of the
Italian <span class='it'>masque</span>, and belongs to that class of poems,
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
which do not depend for their interest on any complication
of plot or conflicts of intense passion, on
dramatic unities or strange developments; startling
scenes and horrible catastrophes. The poem
rather claims and commands our admiration for the
Doric simplicity of its structure, than for any gay
and glittering forms of poetic architecture. Though
dramatic in its plan, the Mask—while it has the
simplest form of the drama—is essentially lyric,
especially in the carol of the Water Nymph and the
song of the attendant spirit, which constitutes a
kind of delicious epilogue to the piece, and concludes
with a beautiful moral lesson:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Mortals, that would follow me,</p>
<p class='line0'>Love Virtue; she alone is free:</p>
<p class='line0'>She can teach you how to climb</p>
<p class='line0'>Higher than the sphery chime;</p>
<p class='line0'>Or if Virtue feeble were,</p>
<p class='line0'>Heaven itself would stoop to her.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, the whole design and execution of the
poem is evidential of that purity of mind, that
chasteness of the imagination, so nobly distinguishing
all the productions of this first of poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no reason why Shakspeare should not
have maintained the same elevated tone of morality
and purity in his immortal works, but that he was
destitute of those religious principles, which purify
the heart, and, indeed, clarify all the powers of the
mind. The polluting habits of his early life, so
closely connected with the stage, when it was in its
deepest debasement, contributed to this malformation
of his moral character. Let it not be said it
was rather the “fault of the age” than of the individual.
Milton was of that age. There was little
more than a generation between them. But the
poet was not ensnared either with the conspicuous
examples of vice before him or around him. In the
midst of a crooked and perverse generation, he shone
as a light of superior brilliancy, entering upon the
responsibilities and trials of life, with a heart full of
love for freedom, and of hatred of tyrants, just at
that illustrious period of the world, when the genius
of Liberty had set her foot on these North American
shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All republicans have a special interest in studying
the genius and character of Milton. He took no
pleasure as did the great dramatic poet, in exalting
the prerogatives, or setting forth the splendors of
royalty. For this he was calumniated by his enemies,
and even Johnson, the inveterate old tory,
joins in the censure of the politician and civilian,
while he praises the poet in such language as this:
“He seems to have been well acquainted with his
own genius, and to know what it was that nature
had bestowed upon him, more bountifully than upon
others; the power of displaying the vast, illuminating
the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the
gloomy, and aggravating the dreadful.” He could
not stoop to trifle among kings and queens, or attempt
to make them conspicuous by his eulogies or representations.
He rose to the sublimities of supernal
worlds. “He sent his faculties out upon discovery,
into worlds where only imagination can travel,
and delighted to form new modes of existence and
furnish sentiment and action to superior beings, to
trace the counsels of hell, or accompany the choirs
of heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His communion with the pure, the spiritual, the
invisible, strengthened the principles of conduct he
had adopted in his anticipation of the judgment of
posterity, and especially in his consciousness of
being “in his great Taskmaster’s eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Comus, his youthful imagination luxuriates
amid the freshness of its own beautiful creations,
amid the wealth which was destined to enrich the
world. Upon the ground of a pure moral sentiment
the flowers of poesy are distributed in the most free
and graceful manner. There is no pandering to the
baser passions of the human heart; no prostitution
of the charms of his muse to the purposes of a secret,
sinful gratification on the part of his readers;
no seductive attempt to “impair the strength of better
thoughts,” or to weaken the sanctions of that
immutable law, which binds together virtue and happiness,
vice and misery. His amaranthine wreath
maybe wet with the “dew of heaven,” such as
descended on his own Paradise, but is never stained
with tears such as innocence weeps, when corrupted
by guilt. “His diadem of beauty,” is set with
gems of the purest water, and most sparkling colors.
The “Lady,” who is wandering in the recesses of
the forest, apprehensive perhaps, of being assailed
by prowling foes, appeals in fervent language:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Oh welcome, pure-eyed Faith; whitehanded Hope,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!</p>
<p class='line0'>And thou, unblemished form of Chastity!</p>
<p class='line0'>I see ye visibly——</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The high lesson breathed through many a glowing
line of this exquisite poem, is the dignity of virtue,
the conservative power of innocence, the
majesty of woman, even in her weakness, that
weakness itself becoming strength, when blended
with a purity, before which the eye of profligacy
quails with very shame at the suggestions of a
guilty heart. In the picture of Comus, the fabled
son of Bacchus and Circe, and the assailant of the
virtuous lady, drawn by the attendant spirit, there
is a powerful argument for temperance, a virtue so
warmly applauded and so little practiced among
men. Comus,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>—To every thirsty wanderer</p>
<p class='line0'>By sly enticement gives his baneful cup,</p>
<p class='line0'>With many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison</p>
<p class='line0'>The visage quite transforms of him that drinks,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the inglorious likeness of a beast</p>
<p class='line0'>Fixes instead, unmoulding reason’s mintage</p>
<p class='line0'>Charactered in the face.—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The imagination of Milton delighted to portray the
moral virtues, often grouping them in fine proportions
and expressive relations. They appear in the
midst of exquisite poetry, gorgeous imagery, and all
manner of glowing thoughts, like beautiful forms of
statuary revealing themselves amidst the luxuriant
vines and verdant foliage of a summer garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene in the palace between the Virgin Lady
and Comus affords occasion for the utterance of noble
sentiments in language worthy of them. She is
supposed to sit in the enchanted chair, her eye resting
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
upon the dainties of a delicious feast, her ear greeted
with strains of the softest music, all the senses, in
fine, addressed in the most tempting manner, when
the Enchanter with his wand appears before her,
and proffers his glass—the true “Circean cup,”
which, being tasted, first intoxicates, then ruins. It
is the intoxication of pleasure in all its forms and fascinations.
This may be called a fable, but it stands
for truth and reality too sadly and fatally experienced
by the children of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Enchanter opens his assault: “If I but wave
this wand, your nerves are all chained up in alabaster.”
The lady nobly replies:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind</p>
<p class='line0'>With all thy charms, although this corporeal rind</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou hast immanacled, while Heaven sees good.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The contest proceeds, and it is one between Truth
and Falsehood, Light and Darkness, Principle and
Profligacy, the Powers Supreme, and the Infernal
Crew. The germ of one portion of Paradise Lost is
here. Those conflicts between mighty opposing
Powers, which constitute so much of the sublime
interest of that great <span class='sc'>Epic</span>, are here typified and foreshadowed.
Some poets would have invested this
incantation of virgin purity with the “armor of
tears,” the resistless eloquence of entreaty, disarming
the sturdiest foe. But no such tender, melting
scenes seem to have been embraced within the design
of the poet. His heroine belongs to a severer
order of the chaste sisterhood. There is a sternness
in her purity, before which even the Enchanter with
his wand is compelled to cower. He plies her with
his enchantments, presses her with arguments worthy
of the father of lies, with sophistry becoming the
most subtle and accomplished deceiver, with flattery
that would turn an ordinary brain. To all this she
replies with all the energy of indignant virtue:
“False traitor,” and charges home the guilt of his
incantations, spurning the offer of all his delicacies
and luxuries:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;—None</p>
<p class='line0'>But such as are good men can give good things,</p>
<p class='line0'>And that which is not good, is not delicious</p>
<p class='line0'>To a well-governed and wise appetite.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Comus affects to despise the philosophy that is taught
from the cynic tub of Diogenes, and ranges over all
Nature for proof that men were intended to revel on
her bounties, to “live while they live;” in fact to
do what those Epicurean philosophers taught, who
said, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.”
Nay, he dares to asperse the purity, and insult the
majesty of Beauty itself:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Beauty is nature’s coin, must not be hoarded,</p>
<p class='line0'>But must be current; and the good thereof</p>
<p class='line0'>Consists in mutual and partaken bliss—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now does the Lady rebuke him with all the true
natural authority of virtue for obtruding his false rules
“pranked in reason’s garb,” and in the true spirit of
Satan bolting out his practical heresies with a fluency
quite beyond the capabilities of the tongue of Virtue.
It is true that in this interview there appears to be,
so far as the Virgin Lady is concerned, a singular
union of the romantic and the sensible, indeed such
a preponderance of the latter as would have been
quite inconsistent with the style and spirit of the
drama, as authenticated by the masters of the histrionic
art. Nevertheless, so great a genius as Milton had
a right to choose in what form he would embody—through
what channel he would pour the exalted
sentiments and burning thoughts which it is the prerogative
of genius to supply. If it pleased him to
set before us naked creations of loveliness, or solitary
symbols of vice and deformity, rather in the
style of the statuary than of the painter of scenes,
then let us be thankful for the gift, and honor the
memory of the giver. Comus is rebuked by the Lady
in such language as this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>That strain continues until the guilty wizard stands
abashed, like Satan before the immaculate angel of
the covenant, feeling how awful virtue is: Comus
confesses his fears of self-condemnation. He felt
“her words set off by some superior power,” and in
spite of his professed exemption from mortal ills,
acknowledges “a cold shuddering dew dips me all
o’er.” Still he resolves to dissemble, and as he is
proceeding with his speech, in rush the brothers of
the lady to the rescue, and scatter all things around
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attendant Spirit again appears on the stage, to
exercise her guardian offices, and speaks at length.
All the speakers are imbued with classical knowledge,
and abound in classical allusions. This is just
Miltonic. They are learned in Latin and Greek.
And why should Milton consult the verisimilitudes of
the stage? In the compass of thirteen lines of a
song by the attendant Spirit, there are several classical
or fabulous names, among them Neptune, Nereus,
Triton, Glaucus, Thetis, Parthenope. How
finely does he interweave them with the thread of
his song, even, by his poetic art, imparting to them
a portion of the melody that is vocal in his verse.
He seems capable of setting to music the whole catalogue
of the Pantheon, the Stoa, the Academy, and
the Temples, whose sublime and impressive architecture
itself suggests an analogy to poetry of a high
order. Then the Nereids, the Dryads, the Fauns
will always be poetical in an humbler sense, so long
as the woods and the waters shall be grateful to the
senses or pleasing to the imagination. Even the
horrid Satyrs are welcomed among his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This poem is full of <span style='font-size:smaller'>MUSIC</span>, reminding us as well
of the beautiful bond—<span class='it'>the indissoluble vinculum</span>—that
unites the sister arts, as of the author’s passion
for the science and the symphonies of sweet sounds.
A good recitation of his Ode on the Nativity is equal
to a grand overture on the organ. <span class='sc'>He</span> was an <span class='sc'>Epic</span>
all over. To quote from this very Comus, he could
originate “strains that might create a soul under the
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
ribs of death.” If he did not absolutely invent the
exquisite epithet “rosy bosomed hours,” (it being
derived from the <span class='it'>Rododatetylos Eos</span>, “rosy-fingered
Aurora” of Homer,) he interwove it most gracefully
in his song, as he did all thoughts, images, and
words which he deemed worthy of adaptation into
the magic structure of his works. They were so
many living, many-colored stones in that glorious
temple of poesy, (be it reverentially spoken,) “not
made with hands,” but elaborated and elevated to
its towering height by those marvelous intellectual
powers which are as much the gift of God as inspiration
itself, and far more identified with the <span style='font-size:smaller'>MAN</span> than
inspiration possibly could be. Oh, how solemn the
spectacle, to contemplate such a genius with his eye
fixed, like that of an ancient prophet, in a vision of
spiritual worlds, peopled, not with the ordinary
phantoms of an earthly imagination, but with beings
of immortal mould and unmeasured power; his ear
open to catch the “ninefold harmony” of the celestial
orders, as they sing and praise the glorious
Creator; his march above the ordinary walks of humanity;
his very soul taking wings, and like the
eagle soaring “with no middle flight,” but passing
“the flaming bounds of time and space,” and ascending
from sphere to sphere until he reaches the
throne of the Eternal, there to hold high communion
with the Invisible God, and the august and awful
associations that surround him, whom “No eye hath
seen nor can see, to whom be honor and power everlasting.”</p>

<p class='line'>Far down through brush, and over mossy stones,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The green marge wetting with its silver spray;</p>
<p class='line'>The path is steep and perilous that leads</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To the cold flushing waters—and few dare</p>
<p class='line'>Descend to quaff refreshment from their flow;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For thick, entangling weeds,</p>

<p class='line'>The small ground-squirrels leave their dwellings dark</p>

<p class='line'>On an old oak with star-moss overgrown,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And reft of branch and bark;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capt. Wolfang Carlo and Don Hilo de Ladron,
seated on the side of the mountain above Angra,
watched the sea brighten along the opposite horizon
and the white tents of the Spanish camp slowly
emerge from the mists in the valley to the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be hard fighting yonder before the commandant
gives in,” the captain said, nodding toward
Nostre Dame de Loup, “and nobody will find time
to look after us for some weeks to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must make our peace with the marquis before
it is over,” Hilo returned indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My plan,” the captain continued, “is to search
along the western coast, and wherever we find a
boat put off in it for St. George. One of the Portuguese
told me the place wasn’t more than half a
dozen leagues off at most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would you do there, brave captain?”
the Spaniard asked with a sneer. “Don’t comfort
yourself that the marquis would let your bull’s-neck
out of his noose, because you merely deserted the
commandant and benefited himself in nothing. But
your friendship for me mustn’t keep you in Tercera.
Perhaps the best thing after all you can do, would be
to go and be hanged; it will come about one of these
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not before I throttle you,” the ex-serjeant muttered,
with a scowl at the back of his careless comrade’s
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joke away,” he added sulkily, aloud. “You’ve
a great chance of catching the count up here, while
there’s a boat to be got, <a id='hav'></a>haven’t you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look you, captain,” Hilo said, raising himself
on his elbow. “There isn’t a boat on this coast, nor
has there been for these three weeks. These rascally
Portuguese have been carrying away their families
and goods in every thing that could float, to
be out of harm’s way until the fighting is fairly over.
I know it is so, for I overheard one of them tell the
count night before last; he had been along shore to
find out. So the viceroy is still in trap, and if you’ve
a mind, you may come along and find where he’s
hidden; or if you like it better, swim over the strait,
or walk down to the marquis’ quarters: you’ve
several acquaintances made in Madrid, you know,
who will be pleased to meet you, captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this reference Wolfang regained enough of his
good humor to show his tusks in a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friends ain’t too many down there, either,”
he rejoined. “If I’m to go with you, let’s hear how
the count is to be caught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my bold captain, we wont catch him at
present, it might be inconvenient for you and I alone
to fight a regiment of even Portuguese. But we will
find out his hiding-place, and with the information
buy our heads from Santa Cruz. Or, who knows,
we may set a snare for him and take him off his
guard; there may be some reward offered for him,
too. What do you say, will you share the doubloons,
or swim over to St. George’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll follow,” Carlo cried, rising and tightening
his belt: the mention of doubloons sounding in his
ears with the proverbial music of the trumpet to a
war-horse. He pulled his <a id='griz'></a>grizzly moustache and
loosened his hanger. Hilo laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” he said. “You’re the sweetest-tempered
gentleman of my acquaintance when gold
is to be got by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no path apparent, and the ascent was
easiest up the bed of a wild gorge they presently discovered.
As height after height was surmounted,
the circle of their horizon widened: St. George and
Pico were visible in the blue field of the ocean to
the right, and over a wooded promontory the hazy
outline of more distant Graciosa. Below lay Angra,
and closer to the left the entrenched village of Nostre
Dame de Loup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long as the thickets abounded, there was no
likelihood of the fugitives attracting attention from
below, but when <span class='it'>el duro</span> was gained, where the bare
surface of rocks lay open to view from all sides, the
adventurers turned back a space, and following a depression
in the chain of mountain-tops, lost sight of
the ocean, and overlooked instead numerous farms
scattered through the little valleys of the highlands
of Tercera. The Portuguese owners had gone off
with their effects, but the grain left in the partially
harvested fields supplied abundant rations. Here the
deserters fixed their head-quarters while conducting
their search for the count, returning nightly with the
caution requisite where the sudden falling in with
any party would have proved perilous. The military
operations on the coast, however, kept the foreign
powers occupied for the present, and no natives were
to be met with, although several country-houses belonging
to members of the viceroy’s court, were
sacked by the outlaws of what few valuables remained.
In the course of a week, it was evident
Torrevedros was secreting himself in some other
quarter, the semi-circle of mountains having been
traversed in all directions and found to terminate in
steep precipices looking inward, leaving the only
points of egress opposite Angra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Hilo and the captain resolved to descend
far enough to turn the heel of the promontory
and reascend on the farther side; a strong easterly
wind lifted the fogs from the lowlands adjacent the
sea, and enveloped the entire height of the mountain,
for which reason, their knowledge of the geography
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
of the country being very imperfect, the pair, before
recognizing any landmarks, were close upon the road
leading to the camp of the commander from the
capital. Both caught the sound of hoofs instantly,
and crouched in a thicket while a half-dozen troopers
galloped by, headed by a knight with his visor up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santiago!” Hilo said, rising to his feet when
the tramp had died away in the direction of the
French camp. “We may spare ourselves the trouble
of finding the count; nothing will save our heads
where that man is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” the captain asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Augustine Inique—may the devil confound
him! I thought him safe in Spain with that whining
daughter of his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wolfang’s face, not usually expressive, was a
blank for some minutes, then slowly relaxed into a
broad grin. The captain’s grin, as I have said elsewhere,
boded no good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark ’e,” he whispered, “what hinders your
getting hold of your fortune, if the knight dies: say,
falls <a id='off'></a>off his horse, or has his casque riddled by a bullet
in battle—or <span class='it'>now</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” Hilo answered quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me your arquebus, it carries a truer ball
than mine,” he added moodily after an interval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain did as he said, and the other tried it
to his shoulder irresolutely twice or thrice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Climbing unsteadies my hand,” he exclaimed
with an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon which the captain cried. “Double the debt
you owe me, and the work will be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might have been two hours after this, that Señor
Inique riding slowly by the spot, lurched violently
over his steed’s neck, which he grasped to save himself
from falling, at the instant his men-at-arms were
startled by the loud report of a carbine. All was consternation,
two of the company running to support
the maître-de-camp, while the others dashed into
the thick mist to the right: the latter presently returned
however with no tidings of the assassins, and
the party conveyed the insensible knight to Angra,
where Padilh was awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Pedro turned pale at the recital. “God forbid!”
he said repeatedly, half aloud to himself, while
musing gloomily by the side of his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Carlo and De Ladron creeping noiselessly
along parallel with the road, the better to baffle
pursuit, came suddenly on the crouching figure
of a man who was endeavoring to hide himself under
a bush. Wolfang took him promptly by the throat,
but before any violence could be done him, Hilo
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, the fellow is a Moor. Look at his black
face and turban.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of that?” returned the captain. “He
must have seen what happened just now, and Moor
or Christian he mustn’t have liberty to use his
tongue again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner during this whispered conference,
looked from one to the other, his oriental eyes dilated
with fear, but making no effort to release his throat;
he had evidently watched the approach of the fugitives
in the hope they would pass by without
noticing him. At the last words he eagerly stretched
his mouth open with a wildly supplicating gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santiago!” both exclaimed in a breath. The
Moor’s tongue was shrunk to half the natural size,
and it appeared evident he could not speak a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is worth his weight in silver,” Hilo said,
looking at him narrowly. “I have heard the count
had a mute slave, and I remember once seeing this
man with him in the Portuguese camp. Let’s
carry the fellow higher up the mountain and compel
him to show us where his master is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Moor’s turban served to bind his arms, and
the three reascending the mountain a space, halted
on the farther side of Angra, which town they passed
so close as to hear the sound of trumpets from
the market-place. The slave confessed by signs, he
had come in search of food for Torrevedros, who,
deserted by his courtiers, was hiding among the
rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is the case,” Hilo remarked in French to
the captain, “we may capture him ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pocket all the doubloons the marquis will
offer,” the captain added greedily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same motive for obedience which had drawn
the acknowledgment of the viceroy’s destitution, a
choice between that and a dagger stroke, induced
the Moor to guide them in the direction of his master’s
lodging, no doubt in the secret hope of wearying
out his heavier-clad companions, and giving them
the slip when opportunity offered. Up and down
steeps they toiled most of the morning; the mist had
disappeared and the sun beat fiercely on the rocks of
the <span class='it'>duro</span>. The phlegmatic Wolfang followed with
plodding endurance, as he would for a piece of gold
to the world’s end, but Hilo’s impatience at last
boiled over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Infidel dog!” he cried. “I will leave your carcass
on this peak if you fail to lead us straight to the
viceroy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the mute paused, whimpered, cast a terrified
look at Hilo’s unpromising countenance, and
ended by turning off abruptly from the course they
were about to pursue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few yards farther, the captain, who was in advance,
cried out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! Yonder goes one of those Portuguese rascals.
Hallo, you sir, come here or I will fetch you
with a bullet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the peasant came down the narrow
path he was ascending hastily, without demur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a poor working-man,” he whined out deprecatingly,
“and have nothing to do with fighting,
señor. For the love of charity, give me something,
for my children to eat, who are dying of hunger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you what will keep you from ever
being hungry,” Hilo answered curtly, “if you don’t
show us where your viceroy is hid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take all the saints to witness, I have not seen
the viceroy this month or more,” the fellow exclaimed,
falling on his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that you are rolling in your mouth?”
Carlo demanded, seizing him suddenly by the jaws
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
and forcing a ducat out. The captain’s interest was
aroused, and he thoroughly searched the clothing of
the Portuguese despite his lamentations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be worse off,” the captain rejoined
after his fruitless trouble, “if you trouble us any
more about your whelps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Hilo crying impatiently, “One is enough to
guide us; leave the idiot alone,” they crossed a
ravine which De Ladron recognized as one they had
before visited, and confirmed a suspicion of the
Moor’s duplicity. Turning upon him in a fury he
uttered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heathen dog, your deceit will end here with
your life,” and struck a blow which the other
escaped by throwing himself on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mute’s mouth worked spasmodically in his
seeming efforts to enunciate, and he eagerly directed
their attention to the path they had just descended.
Hilo caught his meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch him well,” he exclaimed, and bounded
up the steep hill side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peasant was found after a short search, standing
at the narrow entrance of a cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, my good man,” the Spaniard said, showing
him a gold piece. “It goes against our conscience
to take any thing from a poor fellow like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this gracious speech the Portuguese came forward
with alacrity, and Hilo eyed him keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the king’s name I arrest you, Count de Torrevedros!”
he cried on a sudden, seizing the viceroy
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cowardly governor made no resistance, but
looking toward his slave whom the captain had
by this time driven unwillingly to the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretch!” he exclaimed, “you have betrayed
your master, and I would kill you if I had a sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We owe him a grudge ourselves,” Carlo muttered,
and passing his short blade through the Moor’s
body, threw it upon the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare my life, señores!” the alarmed count cried,
trembling and falling on his face. “I will give you
double the sum offered for me by your marquis—double
the sum—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Viceroy of Tercera,” Hilo answered,
contemptuously touching him with his foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show us where your gold is, and you may go,”
Wolfang eagerly put in. But the other put him aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bargain with Santa Cruz for your own head, I
choose not to risk mine for a few extra ducats,” he
said to his avaricious companion, while securing
Torrevedros. And grumbling after his usual fashion,
the Captain was obliged to submit.</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Commandant de Chaste, in the little village
of Nostre Dame de Loup, saw nothing before him
but ruin of one sort or another. Partly out of friendship,
and partly to save Hilo, by a comprehensive
treaty, the two maîtres-de-camp, had urged upon the
marquis, the policy of securing a peaceful surrender
on the part of the French general, rather than drive
to despair, the handful of gentlemen remaining in
the illy-fortified town. Once a secret messenger
carried a note, in which, under cover of solicitude
for his safety, in the event of falling into the power
of Santa-Cruz, a surrender was proposed, but met
with so little favor from the dauntless old knight,
their ambassador found no inconvenience in keeping
in mind the caustic answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must see him in person,” Don Pedro said.—And
the next morning the maîtres-de-camp rode over
together, under a flag of truce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gaunt visages of the cavaliers in the commandant’s
ante-room, showed the strait to which
they were reduced, but they had lost nothing of their
native courtesy, and were all armed from head to
heel, ready to repel an assault at a moment’s warning.
De Chaste himself laid aside his helmet in
honor to his guests, who lost no time in disclosing
their errand, when the others had withdrawn. It
had been agreed beforehand, that Padilh should relate
the leading features of their story in order to
afford a basis for the consequent urgency of the surrender
they came to propose. The commandant
heard the knight through in grave silence: at the
end he mused awhile and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name served him in good stead once, for
with any other he would have been hanged at my
yard-arm for mutiny. It may not be known to you,
messires, the wife of the elder De Ladron, was my
sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” Inique ejaculated, with a sudden red spot
in either sallow cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the calm voice of the old knight, promptly
reassured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are endeavoring to retrieve the past, monseigneur,
and I am no intermeddler. When you
have cleared your conscience, M. de Padilh here,
and I, will talk over the disposition of our unfortunate
nephew. For the rest I submit to the necessity
of the case and the counsel of my companions in
arms, and to-morrow will send an envoy to settle conditions
of surrender.” With which success, the
Spanish cavaliers were well satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an unlucky choice on the part of the commandant
in keeping his promise, to appoint Du Vict,
the same whose blunt speech formerly increased the
viceroy’s enmity to the French. That hotheaded
cavalier proposed terms of advantage, where there
was cause to be thankful for the reception of any
terms at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your commandant I will send him answer
by fifteen hundred fighting men,” Santa-Cruz cried
in a rage, and instantly gave orders for the march of
his infantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crisis, when the marquis refused to halt
an hour, a courier was dispatched in haste by Padilh
to warn the French of their danger, and the unhappy
general, heart-broken at his disasters, and
deserted by all but a remnant of his army, struggled
no longer against his fate. A cavalier of milder
temper was promptly dispatched to accede to any
honorable capitulation, and meeting the Spanish
vanguard half way from Angra, concluded a treaty
by which a free passage was provided to France,
and every gentleman suffered to retain his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inique himself, rode back with the ambassador to
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
console the gray-haired soldier, and it was while returning
from Dame de Loup, his assassination
occurred. Had he delayed an hour, the deadly spot
might have been safely passed, for within that period
De Chaste marched out of his intrenchments,
and into the Spanish camp, accompanied by his
handful of Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two purposes now occupied the attention of
Santa-Cruz; discovering the assassin of his maître-de-camp,
and securing the person of the late viceroy
of the island, for each of which services, he
offered a reward of five hundred ducats, and a free-conduct
to the parties if desired. There was no
lack of competitors for the latter prize, and one of
these exploring detachments, headed by a corporal,
penetrated to the mouth of the cavern at which the
Moor lay, not many hours after the capture of his
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mute had enough vitality remaining, to motion
he had things of consequence to relate, and a
French deserter recognizing the count’s slave, restored
his strength temporarily, by a draught from
his flask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must take the infidel down to Angra, my
men,” the corporal said, after putting his ear close
to the mouth of the Moor. “By St. Boniface! we
came out to fish for minnows, and catch silverfish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After nightfall of the same day, with their customary
<span class='it'>insouciance</span>, the captors of Terrevedros
conducted that unhappy nobleman, bareheaded, his
wrists bound behind him, and in a peasant’s dress,
into the presence of the vindictive marquis, who
loaded him with epithets of contempt, and threats
of a speedy end. Extremity of danger occasionally
exalts a coward into a hero for the time being, and
the only words spoken by the count, were uttered
with a dignity which astonished the Spanish cavaliers
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am content to die,” he said calmly, “since
at least, I have retained strength enough to prefer
doing homage to the devil, than to that perfidious
tyrant, the king of Spain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has signed his own death warrant, as you
are all witnesses, Señores,” the marquis cried,
scarce restraining his anger to words. “Let him be
put in chains until a day is appointed for the traitor’s
execution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, within the walls of Angra, were gathered,
in partial ignorance of such propinquity, the chief
personages of this history; and there leaving them,
the narrative transfers itself from the Azores to
Spain, to a castle opposite a keep, in brief, where
the fancy of faithful Sir Pedro was wont to stray
nightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be assumed a rule in authorship, that no
reader is to be introduced into a heroine’s sick
room; that obliging personage should always be
met at the street-door as a lover might, by the physician,
who good-naturedly preserves his romance
by disclosing none of the disagreeables up stairs.—But
much may be made of a convalescent. The
open windows inhale the blessed air of heaven, to
replace the nauseous smell of drugs, and where the
tumbler with a spoon in it, flanked by a labelled
phial or two, stood on the table, somebody has set a
bouquet of rosebuds and verbena, and a glass plate of
cool grapes: moreover every one smiles now, the
doctor ceases to shake that solemn head of his, and
fears no longer, waylaying and cross <a id='quest'></a>questioning on
the stair, and you, yourself, lie still in a state of
placid pleasure, and watch the preparations for your
comfort, with the sole member of your physical system
inclined to be active.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, it was Doña Viola lay after the subjugation of
the fever which had begun to show its delirious
power in Don Pedro’s presence, and before the
knight reached Lisbon, was extorting from the girl’s
innocent lips, exclamations, equally of denunciation
and passionate love for the graceless Hilo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would become of us in sickness, ladies, deprived
of your attendance?—what would become of
yourselves, if it did not come natural to you all from
the finest lady downward, termagant and gentle alike,
to smooth pillows, decant medicine, and perform
numberless offices in no respect agreeable, but with
the most exquisite gentleness and devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doña Hermosa, (may her memory be kept green!)
suffered no one to overhear poor Viola’s ravings,
but the solemn parish physician, (notwithstanding
whom, she recovered,) and a trusty maid-servant;
and when the crisis had passed, prepared with her
own hands, delicacies of every kind found in her
recipe book. Viola showed her sense of such unaccustomed
petting, poor child, by tasting every thing
and smiling feebly, and Doña Hermosa, woman-like,
felt her charge every day, growing more into her
heart, by reason of her very helplessness and docility.
After a little, the elder lady laid herself out
to rival Scheherazade, and told the invalid all sorts
of pleasant stories to while away the time, varied
with readings from the half dozen books constituting
the knight’s library: she left nothing undone,
which might remove the indefinably sad expression
about her young guest’s mouth, and coax her
thoughts into some other channel than that in which
they seemed commonly to run. And I am of opinion
if any diversion of the sort had been practicable
at the time, the occupation to which these ladies
devoted part of one week, rummaging the stores of
curiosities, first in the castle and afterward in Don
Pedro’s lesser keep, would have served the desired
purpose. During this period, Señora Padilh showed
Señorita Inique her wedding dress, (of course,) and
afterward the very doublet in which Don Pedro had
adorned himself with unusual finery, at the same
auspicious era. She drew the arras aside and exhibited
it, hanging a little apart from its more homely
fellows, with much pride, thinking all the time
what the dear old knight was that moment doing,
and whether he had looked at it often, and with the
same happy associations she now did, when he
was at home: and when Viola walked on, her
interest in the knight’s wardrobe being naturally
limited, she stroked the velvet softly with one white
hand, and looking quickly around, raised the sleeve
to her lips twice at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
It was a silly action, of course, for a lady of her
time of life—she was nearly thirty now—but who
of us has not done more foolish things with less
cause?—and there is something, so altogether winning
and admirable in the untutored fealty of the
sex for ours, when allowed to appear, that I can’t
help despising the man who makes the pretty weaknesses
of a wife or sweetheart, a target for his shallow
wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife of our knight was so occupied with her
thoughts, that she did not at first observe Viola, who
had retired to the embrasure of a window, and by
the position of her head—she stood with her face
directed to a landscape without, but cognizant of
nothing out of her own brain—was quietly weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A milk-and-water heroine, always melancholy,
and shedding a profusion of tears to evince sensibility,
is the reasonable abhorrence of every sensible
reader. But Doña Viola was not of this kind, as
the countess well knew. That kind soul reproached
herself secretly for broaching a subject likely to recall
unhappy recollections in the breast of her
charge, and said something to that effect, while
drawing an arm caressingly around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do yourself injustice, dear lady Hermosa,”
Viola said after an interval, “nothing we have seen
or said, has earned me any pain. You know my
past history,” she added, “and what a ban has been
laid upon my future, by recent events, and should
not wonder much at my yielding to grief whenever
your attention is withdrawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must endeavor, poor little dove, to let your
wounds heal, and forget the author of them,” the
countess answered compassionately, scarcely knowing
what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doña Viola looked at her friend with a faint
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I mention him frequently in my delirium?”
she asked rather abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why yes,” Doña Hermosa replied, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear cousin,” Viola cried quickly, “be assured
of this; Señor de Ladron is nothing to me: not a
particle of the affection, I blush now to have entertained
for him, remains. You see, I speak quite
calmly of it; I could not have done so prior to the
fever, which has apparently revolutionized my mind,
but in truth, only made the climax of an unhappy
passion, after which, comes this quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven be praised!” the countess exclaimed,
with a sense of great relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the saints are my witness, I loved him not
obstinately but dutifully, and until immediately preceding
the return of Don Augustino to Madrid, when
the wickedness of the steps he took to annul our
betrothment, first came to my knowledge, (and
crazed me, I believe,) I had always believed him
faithful to the letter, if not to the spirit, of our ill-advised
contract: for he never once made an appeal,
which self-respect would have compelled me to acquiesce
in, had I loved him thrice as much. The most
I did, was to suspect his coolness, but I easily found
excuse for that, as any woman would, and for many
painful scenes which I thought time and marriage
would remedy. I purposed being a good wife to
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Angels of mercy!” her friend broke in. “Did
you receive no notes, no messages from him, insisting
upon the contract being annulled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” Viola answered. “Whatever I may
have said to Don Pedro and yourself, in delirium,
the truth is, as I have just related it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, there has been very, very wicked work.”
Hermosa exclaimed, with extraordinary vehemence
for so placid a disposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh that I were a man—a knight. Oh, that Don
Pedro, or even Señor Inique, were here to ferret out
this mystery!” With which wild words, to show
how much she was a woman, and how dependent
on the absent hero, she fell upon the neck of her
disturbed protegée, and the two wept in great harmony
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doubts and difficulties which perplexed these
two innocent heads from this hour, and led to innumerable
discussions and secret conclaves, harassed
chiefly by the impression left after each debate, of
subtle enmity having been at work, although why
and through whose agency, they could not even conjecture.
Doña Hermosa told what little she had heard
of Hilo’s passion for a French ambassador’s daughter,
and so accounted for his wish to break his
former engagement; but all the rest remained in the
dark. If Viola had received no notice of Hilo’s desire
to release himself from a distasteful union, the
person or persons who suppressed his letters may
have used her name in such a manner as to irritate
him into the extraordinary steps he had taken to be
rid of an intolerable because obstinate burden, and
the same miscreants had doubtless unbarred the shutter
to Captain Carlo and assisted that worthy’s
escape; but this was all sheer conjecture. Indeed it
could not be so, for all were long proved servants
except a lad she employed as a page out of respect
for the old nurse who had reared her from infancy,
and for the few past years had been employed in
taking charge of her poor brother with Don Augustino.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While such speculations engaged their thoughts, a
letter arrived from the knight by a returned caravel,
announcing the safe landing of the Spanish army and
strait of the French, deserted by the Portuguese, and
stating the confession made by Inique on shipboard.
Doña Hermosa communicated this strange intelligence
to Don Augustino’s daughter, and the two, as
might be predicated always of two women in like
circumstances, cried over it together, and then discussed
the event in all its bearings. Viola also cried
a good deal in private, for despite her disavowal of
love for Hilo, she found it difficult to convert a lately
affianced husband into a brother on such short notice;
but in the course of a day or two her reflections
took another shape. Was it not better to love him
as a brother who indeed would never, she knew
now, have been any thing else to her even without
this obstacle? But how did she know she still had a
living brother; between two such fiery tempers,
what collision might not take place through ignorance
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
on the one side and rashness on the other?
Oh, she must hasten to interpose, to effect a reconciliation
if any misunderstanding existed, to earn
some consideration, too, from her brother, by undeceiving
him as to her former apparent immodesty;
and moreover this mystery, so closely touching her
honor, must be probed. She came down to breakfast
the third morning with her mind fully made up,
and before the meal was over astonished her hostess
by soliciting her protection in a voyage to Tercera.
At first the countess strongly opposed the design, but
in the end, of course, entered into it with her whole
heart. What arguments Viola used are not worth recapitulating
here; they were not very strong or philosophical,
but were enunciated with much self-deceptive
sophistry and based on affection, which is
all that is requisite in feminine debates as a general
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The household was put in complete order and
turned over with the estate to the care of a trusty
major-domo, and an old cavalier, a relative of the
countess, who had been summoned to attend, was
pressed into service after a feeble remonstrance; he
had been a great beau in his day and could not find
it in his heart to long oppose the will of a lady; and
dispatched to charter a vessel in which to accompany
them to the Azores. The friends, attended by
a detachment of the Hermandad for protection along
the road, followed close at his heels, and were soon
after out of sight of the shores of Spain, and as incredulous
of surviving the miseries of the voyage as
any ladies of the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere about this time, an old woman saying
aves as fast as her trembling fingers could slip the
beads, in the cabin of a crazy ship flying before a
furious gale straight for the rocky shores of Graciosa,
might have given the needful clue to this labyrinth
of conjecture: so might, if he had possessed the capacity,
the poor wretch who sat watching her in
greater awe than the tempest excited, from the crib
in which he lay bound, and who had wondered time
and again in his imbecile way, what it was she
mumbled to herself when hobbling up and down the
cabin floor in fair weather, her chin elevated in the
air. She never cared for his overhearing, a glance
was enough at any moment to make him cower and
blink in fear of the crutch which, during Señor
Inique’s absence, not seldom corrected his waywardness.
This vessel with others, had been driven
from her moorings off Praya, and parting company
became unmanageable: one afternoon the peaks of
Graciosa suddenly appeared through a rift in the
surging mist around, in terrible proximity, and coasting
the island a few leagues, by daybreak the next
morning the ship struck and immediately after took
its final plunge. They had fallen into a gap of the
rock-bound shores, and in the comparatively quiet
sea, contrived, like St. Paul’s companions, to reach
shore on whatever came to hand. The crew congratulated
themselves on every soul being saved but
the captain, who was below deck when the wreck
went down; it was supposed he had descended to
secure treasure of some sort, but the crone who listened
to their talk while they all dried themselves
about a fire, knew better; for at the first alarm, while
clambering up the cabin stairs, she encountered the
captain in wild haste to save his patron’s son. She
tore herself loose from his clutch and had seen neither
of them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s sorry, who’s sorry, eh?” she mumbled
repeatedly to herself, wagging her scheming old
head with a wicked leer. But she shed abundance
of crocodile tears a day or two later when relating
the sad event to the Countess Padilh and Doña Viola,
whose vessel compelled them to touch at Graciosa
to repair some little damages suffered during the gale.
Other tears were shed upon the occasion, but fewer
than would have followed a like announcement ten
days back to Viola, whose mind was too much engrossed
by the object of her mission to grieve much
over a death which seemed a providence.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>While the two ladies were preparing to continue
their voyage, strange disclosures had followed the
condemnation of the Viceroy of Tercera in the
Spanish camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite their recklessness, Hilo and Carlo had
judged it best to show themselves as little as possible
where they were likely to meet with importunate
acquaintances; their plan was to convey the prisoner
after night-fall to Angra, and beg a prompt
payment of the reward and a free conduct. The
better to elude observation they had smeared their
cheeks with the thick juice of berries used by the
natives to protect the skin from the sun, and wore
the loose frock and silver ear-rings of Portuguese
peasants, in which costume they had conducted their
search for the unfortunate count. The presence of
the French troops greatly increased the risk of recognition,
but with night and this disguise the adventurers
considered no great risk would be run: Santa
Cruz was proverbially headstrong and impetuous,
and once a free conduct was granted would not
easily be led to retract it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Moorish dog would have known us in
these clothes if nobody else,” Wolfang said, well
satisfied with their success, outside the walls of
Angra. “But by this time the ravens are picking
his bones on the peak, as I’m a living man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereas the Moor was at that moment lying in a
tent not ten yards from the speaker, in care of a corporal,
and attended by Padilh, a few cavaliers, and
a notary in act of writing. So little life remained in
the poor wretch that his usually husky and uncertain
speech consequent on a maimed tongue, was
scarcely audible, but he related his story between
gasps with fierce eagerness, and the scribe read
aloud as he wrote to confirm the statement. The
deposition, after a short reference to the count’s condition,
took this form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made them believe I was dumb by showing
them my withered tongue to save its being cut out.
I am accustomed to make myself understood as much
by gestures of the hand as word of mouth, because
speaking is attended with great effort, and found no
difficulty in carrying out the deception. I would
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
have cried out once when stabbed, but the reproaches
of the viceroy my master for betraying him, although
it was at the last extremity to save my life, gave me
resolution to shut my teeth and fall as if dead. I
loved him much, he was good to me; I wished to
revenge him. Perhaps if they had thought I could
speak at times, they would have been at more pains
to see if I was dead. When they caught me I was
trying to escape by crawling from bush to bush,
under cover of the thick fog the high wind had driven
up the mountain. I had come to get food for my
master, as we were almost famished, and hearing
the trampling of horses hid myself till they should
pass. At the same time two men, dressed like Portuguese
islanders but speaking Spanish, came close
to where I was and crouched down also. I could
not go away or even stir for more than an hour, for
fear of being killed; for the last comers remained
where they were after the Spaniards had gone by,
and talked of killing some one of the party on their
return. One was short and thick-set, the other
slender and younger; the former offered to assassinate
the individual referred to, for something I could
not understand, which the other agreed to; the
younger saw that the charge of the arquebuss was
all right and handed him the piece. When the company
came back from the direction of Dame de Loup,
the first named shot the cavalier in advance, and I
saw him fall forward. I knew him to be a maître-de-camp
then, for his baton dropped to the ground.
I made off in the confusion, the assassins having first
done so, but from not knowing the ground well they
made a circuit and came upon me a few paces off.
This time they saw and seized me as I have related.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Padilh asked a few questions regarding the personal
appearance of the pretended peasants, more
especially of the one designated as slender, but the
answers received were not at all conclusive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that all his wants are supplied,” the maître-de-camp
said, after musing a space in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be kept alive,” he added to the gentlemen
with him, on their way to the quarters of the
marquis; “we may need him to confront the assassins
should they venture in with their prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The surest way of securing your purpose,” an
old knight suggested, “would be to promise him
safety and the reward offered for the information he
has given: a hint that something may be done to
save his master might add to his desire of living. If
you consent, Sir Pedro, I will return and try the effect
on the poor devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well thought of,” Padilh answered. “Do
so without delay. I doubt if these men will put
themselves in our power after all, but it is best to be
prepared to receive them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Pedro’s doubt was terminated immediately
after entering the city, for in turning a corner they
suddenly encountered a party with lights and a prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Count de Torrevedros,” the officer in
command answered to the maître-de-camp’s inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible,” the knight returned, regarding
sorrowfully the mean figure shown by the torches
the soldiers held aloft for the purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He speaks the truth—I am that unfortunate man,”
the count said dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon which Padilh exclaimed—“It would be a
shame to knighthood to see the representative of any
king stand bare-headed,” and placed his own bonnet
on the viceroy’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me your word as a knight and nobleman
that you will not attempt to escape Señor Count,” he
added immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be so vain to think of it, that I pledge
my honor willingly, sir,” the count rejoined, “if it
gives you any satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unbind his arms,” the maître-de-camp said,
turning to the officer, “I will be responsible. See
that he wants no comfort, and let his expenses be set
to my cost. A viceroy in such condition has had his
share of misfortune already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which injunction spoken aside the knight
hastened on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is not your Cid returned to life,” the count
said slightly smiling, “it can only be Don Pedro de
Padilh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” the officer replied, unloosening
his cord, “he is the very mirror of Spanish chivalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, the maître-de-camp, followed by his
suite, rapidly neared the quarters of the marquis.
From a swift walk they fell into a run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must make haste or the vultures will have
flown,” he said, and not without reason, for at the
moment they arrived in front of the house occupied
by the Spanish commander, two men were in the act
of coming out. The stream of light from the rooms
behind showed at once that one was taller and more
slender than the other, and that both wore peasant’s
frocks, and the stouter of the couple at the instant
jingled the contents of a bag in his hand, and said
something with a laugh to his comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of the King of Spain,” Don Pedro
cried advancing, “I arrest you for murder. Draw
your swords gentlemen and close in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse the luck!” Wolfang unguardedly exclaimed,
grinding his teeth with rage; “another half
hour and we would have been safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold your tongue, fool!” Hilo said sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who dares oppose a free conduct of the commander-in-chief,
Marquis of Santa Cruz,” he demanded
aloud, showing a bit of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—maître-de-camp of the marquis,” Padilh rejoined,
“and until his further pleasure is known, you
will remain my prisoners.” And without staying
for more words the knight passed through a private
door and straight to the rooms of Santa Cruz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That nobleman was stepping out upon a balcony
to learn the cause of the disturbance below, but
turned back on seeing Don Pedro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brawl is this at my door?” he asked in no
pleasant tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have taken it upon myself to disregard the passport
of your excellency, and arrest the men you dismissed
a moment ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
“Ha!” interrupted Santa Cruz, frowning. “And
why, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspect them to be the assassins of my colleague,”
the knight returned; “I have proof to that
effect by which you can judge if I have done more
than my duty, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak on,” the other said, and Padilh at once
gave a brief narrative of the events within his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end, the marquis said: “I was hasty in
thinking you over zealous. These fellows must be
brought face to face with their accuser, and to make
that sure, their examination shall be immediate.
Send quickly for the Moor you speak of—but how is
it that you are without a cap, Don Pedro?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met the viceroy bare-headed,” the knight answered,
with honest bluntness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which Santa Cruz, something nettled, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the three kings! You will teach us presently
to be worthy our spurs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captors of the unfortunate viceroy returned to
the presence of the marquis with no good grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer no questions,” Hilo muttered to the captain,
“and they can prove nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But both were startled by the appearance of a witness
they believed beyond the power of lifting a
finger, and leagues away. Hilo uttered a savage
oath of surprise, and Wolfang stood staring at the
former mute, with his villainous mouth agape. Both
heard the deposition read through and affirmed, without
interfering or replying a syllable to any questions
asked. The captain’s animal spirits had quite deserted
him, and sullenness gave his face strong resemblance
to a bull’s, while his fellow prisoner’s
sharp features suited the cat-like activity of his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The evidence is complete enough,” the marquis
exclaimed finally; “and, by Heaven, gentlemen, these
villains shall swing within twenty-four hours. Off
with their sorry disguises, and let us see if they will
persist in their insolence still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hilo, without waiting for the enforcement of
the order, threw his peasant’s frock from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you call yourself Don Pedro de Padilh,” he
cried to the knight, “take this gall to your pride.
All Spain shall know before I die whose uncle you
are, and that you brought your own blood to this
strait; I swear it here before all the saints, and can
prove my words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg you, sir, to make no account of my relationship,”
Padilh said smiling to Santa Cruz. “In
good season, gentlemen, you will understand this
innuendo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not to be led astray by such a fellow’s
lies,” the marquis replied, with a contemptuous
laugh. “We have had enough of their company,
señores, and leave them to you, Padilh, to have cared
for. Only see that escape is made impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” Hilo exclaimed; “one word, my lord
marquis, before I go. Knights and gentlemen here
present, bear witness I hold in my hand the written
parole of free conduct of this man—a thing no knight
ever violated before. Santa Cruz I tear your worthless
paper to atoms, thus, and proclaim you an infamous
liar—a liar!” he reiterated, at the highest pitch
of his voice, and stamping with impotent fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marquis, a man of unbridled passions, lost all
command of himself at this insolent speech; his stiff
beard bristled from excess of rage, like a boar’s
back, and his sword was in his hand in an instant.
But a number of cavaliers placed themselves simultaneously
between, and Padilh grasped his sword-arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord—my lord, you forget yourself and justice!”
he uttered, in that steady voice which asserted
the true superiority of the man, and caused
the blood to return to the face of the great captain.
He looked at Don Pedro savagely a moment; but
before dismissing his court he had recovered sufficient
equanimity to pay a compliment to the latter,
who was absent seeing to the disposal of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No knight is more worthy the name,” he
added with a grim smile, “although he is somewhat
rough and unguarded in performance of his duty, at
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day following the marquis and his maître-de-camp
met in secret council. The former heard with
surprise the history of De Ladron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wretch has put a climax to his crimes in
this last,” he cried, “and please Heaven it shall be
also the last he commits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” the ample-hearted knight answered,
“he would not have done such a wickedness knowingly.
It is hard to believe so young a man could
have so far fallen in villainy as to assassinate his
own father, recognizing him as such. Doubtless the
papers placed in De Haye’s hands never reached
their destination. That unhappy gentleman fell in
the first battle beyond Praya.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” Santa Cruz replied, thoughtfully, “and
out of love to Inique I reverse my sentence, and
postpone the day of execution until after that faithful
cavalier draws his last breath; a period not far distant,
his surgeon tells me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So near,” Padilh replied, “that I think, my lord,
M. de Chaste, you and I, to whom only the secret of
his life is known, should remain custodians of his
honor, and preserve his name from vulgar censure
after death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give my hand to the compact cheerfully,” the
other responded, and Don Pedro repaired at once to
the quarters of the French commandant to enlist
his neutrality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will comprehend M. de Chaste,” he said,
among other things, to that weather-beaten pattern
of chivalry, “by what knightly motives I have been
impelled to shun no duty incumbent on my office.
And had he been my own nephew, wicked as he is,
I would not have screened him from the full weight
of justice he deserves. Our strenuous aim now should
be to save Inique the knowledge of his son’s fate,
and if possible, of even his vicinity to himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not easy to do where no visiter to
Inique’s bedside saw any reason for withholding the
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
most important news, and in the course of a few
days the dying soldier knew the worst and mastered
it, and quietly desired Padilh to obtain permission
for a last interview with his—his son. The word
stuck in his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight replied—“As soon as your recovery
is advanced, or failing that, when you feel death
drawing on, I will oppose nothing to your wish,
Inique. But for the present spare yourself so agitating
an encounter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Pedro,” the wounded maître-de-camp answered,
smiling faintly, “I wish to make my peace
with the boy and acknowledge my sins, but you well
understand where my most affectionate thoughts
rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which Padilh assented gravely. He was thinking
at the moment in what manner the tidings of the
dispersion of the fleet at Praya, could be suppressed
without equivocation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be compelled to confess the truth at last,”
the honest gentleman said despairingly when alone,
and still weighing the even balance of duty in his
mind. “But it sadly perplexes a mortal intellect,
Heaven knows, to distinguish between what is due
one’s friend and one’s soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, the last words spoken that evening by Don
Augustino were to this effect: “Send a courier to
Praya and let the boy be brought here immediately.
I <span class='it'>must</span> see him once more, and I haven’t many
hours to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But succor came unexpectedly to the upright
knight, the succeeding morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his custom to pace a quay, looking seaward
every dawn, in anxious hope of the appearance
of the missing ship, the others having already
made harbor at Praya and elsewhere; and for the
first time he saw a sail on the northwestern horizon.
Some hours later Padilh himself, boarded the vessel
and was surprised beyond measure to find his countess
and her protegée on board. His gratification,
however, was even greater, and so he told her, on
hearing the somewhat vague account of the object
of this voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a madcap enterprise,” he said, smiling,
“but the end is undoubtedly good; I would have sent
for Doña Viola, if there had been the least probability
of her arriving in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A speech which greatly reassured Doña Hermosa,
who had been considering during the voyage, what
good reason she could offer her lord, for sanctioning
the expedition, and had found with dismay there
would be none forthcoming. As ladies generally do
they had laid their hearts together in the first instance,
instead of their heads, and mistook sentiment
for conviction, after their usual fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a more disturbed mind, the knight listened
to the recital of the shipwreck, and subsequently
cross questioned the old woman accompanying them,
who made no favorable impression. “I don't like
her,” he told his countess; “she sheds too many
crocodile tears, over a disaster, which to only one
person concerned, can appear in any other light, than
a cessation of pain. I have cautioned her to keep
out of sight for the present, as the knowledge would
assuredly kill Don Augustino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was necessary to break the news of her father’s
situation, and its antecedents to poor Viola, who by
imagining the occurrence of all manner of evils
during the few past weeks, had arrived at a state of
mind not entirely unprepared for any thing, and the
two ladies mingled their tears freely together, while
Don Pedro returned to prepare his associate for the
meeting. Little preparation was needed in this
quarter, the dying man’s thoughts being occupied by
a single object. Who of us can fix a bound to the
justice of Heaven, and blasphemously call all beyond
it harsh exercise of omnipotent power. It
seems to me even retribution, that this soldier who
had prided himself above all things, on his honor
and the world’s applause, should die without one
scrip of either, if what was conceded in acknowledgement
of his tardy confession be excepted, and
from compassion had, step by step, arrived at
such a state of infatuation for the witness of his
passionate pride at St. Quentin, that natural affection
for his own offspring seemed almost wholly stifled,
and the ignominious fate of his accredited son, gave
occasion to scarce any emotion. People are apt to
attribute such perverseness to want of sanity, much
as a coroner’s jury gives in a like verdict in cases of
suicide; yet Inique was as collected as you or I,
and his weakness merely physical. The man’s nature
had received a wrench in youth, and the tree
retained the twist, only shifting the direction of its
growth as it worked around. If he had lived long
enough, he might have been more penitent or less,
nearer a saint or more openly a sinner. How many
mercies, and how many lies, our lives will example
at the last great day, none of us living can compute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldier was, therefore, not much agitated by
the sobs of his daughter, but without agitation, life
was fast ebbing now, and in accordance with his
promise, Padilh brought Hilo from his prison for a
final interview. That young gentleman had been
whiling away the time at dice, and left the captain
in no good humor at the interruption to his run of
luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why am I brought here?” he asked after a supercilious
glance around. “Is avenging an injury
so uncommon? If this man had not withheld my
dues he would not have received his own as you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched young man,” the dying maître-de-camp
said feebly, rather than sternly, “I had hoped
to learn in the haste of the trial, some error had been
made, and that it was not from your hand this ball
came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not from my hand,” Hilo interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven be praised, for as all here can witness
you are my son and not De Ladron’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words, Hilo started and turned pale, but
his face was instantly flushed with passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a base lie—a lie,” he exclaimed through
his teeth, scowling around. “It is a shallow trick
to cheat me out of my inheritance at the last
gasp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother!” sobbed out Viola, deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
“Sir—son,” Inique cried, “I cannot disprove
your bitter words by leaving you a fortune of my
own; for the real son of De Ladron, whom I made
an idiot, is the heir of the estate I hold. Forgive
what actual wrong I have done you as a parent,
remembering how soon the end of us both must
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he ceased speaking, a figure, coming no
one knew whence, in the consternation of the moment,
hobbled between, and cast a baneful look on
Inique from a pair of ferret eyes sparkling with
rage and malice. Her rage was so great that she
mouthed and champed with her old toothless jaws,
before a word could be emitted. The wounded
knight sat bolt upright in bed, gazing at her wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is my boy—speak woman, speak?” he
cried, with a sudden return of strength and voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Food for fishes—ah ha! food for fishes!” She
mumbled out, pointing with her crooked finger
mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, heaven be merciful! he is dying—Hermosa—Don
Pedro—help!” Viola exclaimed, receiving
the cavalier’s weight in her quickly opened
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, he’s dying at last,” the crone screamed
“I killed him—me and my son. He’s cheated us
both, but we’ve paid him back, and I’ve got money
enough saved up to keep you in pocket money, my
pretty game-chick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hag!” Hilo ejaculated, shaking loose the old
woman’s clutch on his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey now,” she retorted, threatening him with
her finger, “mind what I say. I’ve gold enough
for both, without that swindler’s there. I wanted
you to have that too. I would have been an honest
girl, but for him, and he owed you a living; so
I put you in place of your namesake, when a baby.
I’ve been caring for you ever since. I wouldn’t let
you marry who you wanted, because I wanted you
to marry somebody richer than your French countess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She devil—I spit on you,” her son broke in
furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this my reward?” she shrieked, “mind, I
have gold which you’ll never handle—you might if
you were dutiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And mutually vilifying each other, the mother and
her offspring, were carried out from the ante-chamber
by the guards of the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, the <a id='foot'></a>footlights begin to burn dim—one of
the chief personages of this story, without so much
will left of all his willfulness, to put his blind arms
about his daughter, and confess his short-comings,
and without a tatter hanging about him of former
arrogance, lies expiring—the orchestra plays a dirge—the
drop scene comes slowly down—all is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One act more, and a short one closes the drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Wolfang Carlo, it may be borne in mind,
had retained about his person, the papers taken from
De Haye’s doublet, and from time to time, as opportunity
offered, spelled out the meaning in private.—He
was not inclined to think them of much value,
and felt only a lazy curiosity in regard to the contents,
but a reference to his comrade, he had met
with during his last perusal, joined to the expressions
let fall by Padilh, at the examination before the
marquis, excited intolerable suspicions in his avaricious
soul. What! after months and years of watching
and following about like a dog; to find himself
swindled and his debtor an impostor and penniless.
He must see. And the captain eagerly embraced
the rare interval of privacy afforded by the <a id='abs'></a>absence
of De Ladron with Inique, to find in the MS. in his
<a id='poss'></a>possession some warrant for his doubts. As the
honest free soldier read laboriously, the veins in his
forehead and cheeks swelled and purpled; he
churned his tusks like any other savage boar, and
finally threw himself on the stone floor, howling
and beating the flags with his clenched fists. This
frenzy was in full vigor, when Hilo entered, unguardedly
and in no amiable mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Flemish hog!” he cried imperiously,
applying his foot to the other’s ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did get up; with a yell heard by the guard
through the thick wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the time it took to unbar and unclose the door,
Wolfang had added one more to his list of crimes,
and the wretched old woman, who had been placed
in the same cell at her own stipulation, was discovered
vainly endeavoring to break the hold of the
former on her son’s throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Come children; cries the great exhibiter of vanity-fair,
let us shut up the box and the puppets, for
our play is played out.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>THE RUFFED GROUSE.</span> (<span class='it'>Tetrao Umbellus.</span>)</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The beautiful bird which is depicted above, is that
known as the Partridge, in New Jersey, and all the States
east and north of the Delaware, and as the Pheasant everywhere
to the westward of that fine stream; and by these
provincial vulgarisms it is like to be known and designated,
until sportsmen will take the trouble of acquiring
a little knowledge of their own trade, and will cease to
regard naturalists as mere theorizing bookmen, and scientific
names and distinctions as supererogatory humbug.
The distinction between the Grouse and other birds of
the gallinaceous order, is that the former are invariably,
the latter never, feathered below the knee. This distinction
never fails, and is very easily noted; although, in
different species of the genus, the extent of the feathering
differs. In the Ruffed Grouse the soft fleecy feathering of
the leg is sparse, and descends only to the middle of the
shank. In the Pinnated Grouse, Prairie Hen of the West,
and Grouse of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Rhode
Island, the legs are feathered the whole way down the
shank, to the insertion of the toes; and the same is the
case of the Canada Grouse, or Spruce Partridge of the
remote Eastern States. In all those species of Grouse,
which are known as Ptarmigan, dwellers of the extreme
north, or in the northern temperature of iced mountain-tops,
the feathering continues the whole length of the toes
quite to the insertion of the claws—this I merely mention
<span class='it'>par parenthese</span>, as there is but one of the Ptarmigans likely
to fall within reach of the sportsman; namely, the Willow-Grouse,
or Red-Necked Partridge of the extreme parts of
Maine, and the Easternmost British provinces, and thence
so far as to the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These distinctions are easily borne in mind, nor will be
found all-sufficient to the discriminating woodsman, who
desires to be able to call things by their right names, and
to give a reason for doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>true</span> Pheasant is a native of Asia originally, though
it has been naturalized in Europe, since a very early
period, and is now abundant in France and England.
No species of this bird, which is distinguished by a pointed
tail, above half a yard in length, and by its splendidly
gorgeous coloring, little inferior in intensity to that of
the Peacock, has ever been found, or is believed to exist
in any portion of the Western hemisphere; although those
singular and showy birds, the <span class='it'>Curaçoas</span> of South America,
have some relation to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same is true of the <span class='it'>real</span> Partridge; although the
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
Quail of this continent would seem to be its equivalent;
being as it were a connecting link between the European
Quail, and the Partridge of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ruffed Grouse ranges over a very wide portion of
the United States and British provinces, from the 51st
degree of north latitude to the Atlantic sea-board, although
it is much more scarce in the Southern States than in the
midland and northern regions. It is remarkable also that
it varies exceedingly in color; those to the northward
being comparatively dull and gray, to those of Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, and more genial regions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinctive feature, whence this bird derives his
title of <span class='it'>Ruffed</span> Grouse, is the tuft or tippet of jet-black
feathers, glossed with metallic hues, which are shown
more or less distinctly in each of the figures in the woodcut
at the head of this paper, but the most decidedly in the
cock-bird, represented as standing on a fallen log, in the
act of drumming, with these ruffs elevated, and his tail
erected and expanded after the manner of a Turkey or
Peacock, in the season of his amorous phantasies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This drumming, a sound sufficiently familiar to all ears
accustomed to the sights and noises of the forest, is no
less than the call of the male bird to his harem of attendant
wives; for the Ruffed Grouse, unlike our pretty,
constant, and domestic Quail, selects himself no one fond
partner, whom to cheer with his loved notes, to comfort
and amuse during the breeding season, but rejoices like a
veritable grand Signor in a multiplicity of fair sultanas,
whom so soon as they betake themselves to the cares of
maternity, he abandons, like a <span class='it'>roué</span> as he is, and passes the
remainder of the season, until the broods disperse in the
autumn, in company with small packs of his own faithless
sex, reveling and enjoying himself on the mountain sides,
in his loved pines and hemlocks, while his forgotten loves
brood patient over the hopes of the coming season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This drumming,” says Wilson, in his eloquent and
animated page, “is most common in spring, and is the
call of the cock to a favorite female. It is produced in
the following manner: the bird, standing on an old prostrate
log, generally in a retired situation, lowers his
wings, erects his expanded tail, contracts his throat,
elevates the two tufts of feathers on the neck, and inflates
his whole body something in the manner of a Turkey cock
strutting and wheeling about in great stateliness. After
a few manœuvres of this kind, he begins to strike his
stiffened wings in short and quick strokes, which become
more and more rapid until they run into each other, resembling
the rumbling sound of very distant thunder
dying away gradually on the ear. After a few minutes’
pause, this is again repeated, and in a calm day may be
heard nearly a mile off. This is most common in the
morning and evening, though I have heard them drumming
at all hours of the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is singular, that so exact an authority as Wilson has
proved himself to be, should fall into the strange error of
speaking of this singular amorous sound as a call to a
<span class='it'>single</span> female; and elsewhere of the <span class='it'>Pheasant</span>, as he
erroneously calls it, paining; when it is notorious to all
who have closely observed the habits of this bird, that it
is polygamous. Such, I believe, will be found the case
with all those gallinaceous birds which have on especial
summons, or peculiar display of attitudes, airs, and splendors
by which to attract the females; as may be observed
of the common Game-cock, the Turkey, the Peacock, and
the European Pheasant; no one of which takes to himself
an especial and chosen partner, but disports himself in his
wanton seraglio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On many occasions, during this particular season, I
have stolen up to within a few yards of the log, whereon
the Ruffed Grouse was so busily employed in summoning
his dames and demoiselles around him, that he had no ears
or eyes for my approach, which at any other period he
would have discovered long before, and whirred away
tumultuous on terrified and sounding pinions. I have lain
concealed, for an hour at a time, watching with intense
gratification the beautiful and animated gestures of the
cock, now strutting and drumming on his log, proud as an
eastern despot, now descending to caress and dally with
his numerous Roxolanas, and then reascending to his post
of pride, to send his resonant call far through the haunted
echoes of the umbrageous pine-woods. On one such
chance, I saw no less than seven hen birds gathered around
a single male, all in turn expectant of his looked-for attentions,
and all gratified by a share of his notice. If this
be not Polygamy, I should like to receive the Grand Turk’s
opinion on the subject, as I confess myself, if it be any
thing less, in a state of absolute benightedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ruffed Grouse begins her nest very early in May,
and lays from eight to fifteen brownish-white, unspotted
eggs, nearly the size of those of a pullet. With the exact
period of this bird’s incubation I am not acquainted; the
young birds run the instant they clip the shell; obey the
cluck of the mother, as chickens that of the hen; and are
tended by her with extreme care and solicitude. In case
of her being surprised with her young about her, she resorts
to all the artifices practiced by the Quail, and even
by the comparatively dull and stolid Woodcock, to draw
away the intruder from the vicinity, feigning lameness
and incapacity to fly, until she shall have lured
away the pursuer far from the hiding-place of her fledglings.
Then she shall whirr away on resonant and powerful
pinions, up, up above the tops of the tall pines and
hemlocks, and thence skate homeward noiseless on
balanced wings, where she will find them close ensconced
among the sheltering fern-tufts, or the matted
winter-greens and whortleberry bushes, viewless to the
most prying eye, and undiscoverable, save to the nose of
the unerring spaniel. But once returned, you shall see
them emerge, chirping feebly at the soft maternal cluck,
and hurrying to enshroud them under the shelter of her
guardian wing, and nestle, happy younglings, among the
downy plumage of her maternal breast. Curses upon the
sacrilegious hand that would interrupt that sweet and
tender scene by the sharp click of the murderous trigger;
yet there be brutes, in the guise of men, who scruple not
to butcher the drumming cock, taken at fatal disadvantage,
amid his admiring harem; scruple not to slaughter the
brooding mother above her miserable younglings—but to
such we cry avaunt! to such we deny the name of sportsmen,
nay, but of Christians, or of men! Get ye behind us,
murderous pot-hunters!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young broods grow rapidly; and by the time they
have reached the size of the Quail, fly well and strongly
on the wing. By the middle, or latter end of August,
they are three parts grown, and fully feathered, with the
exception of the tail, which is not yet complete, and retains
a pointed form. The blundering legislation of this
country in general, on the subject of the game-laws, has,
in this instance, to my ideas, exceeded itself; for during
the months of September and October, when the broods
are still united under the care of the mother, the birds
lying well to the setter, and when flushed scattering themselves
singly here and there among low undergrowth or
bushes, and rarely or never taking to the tree, we are
prohibited from shooting this bold, hardy, rambling, and
shy bird; this, at a later season, wild hunter of inaccessible
rock-ledges, impenetrable rhododendron brakes, and
deep sequestered hemlock-swamps; this, the most uncomatable
and self-protecting bird of all the varieties of
American game; the only variety, perhaps, which never
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
can by any means, fair or unfair, be exterminated from
among us, so long us the rock-ribbed mountains tower toward
the skies, and the forests clothe them with foliage
never sere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this period they would afford rare sport, as at all
other seasons they afford none; and are, moreover, in far
the best condition for the table, as the old birds are apt to
be dry, unless hung up for several weeks before being
cooked, which can, of course, only be done in winter,
when the coldness of the weather prevents their becoming
tainted, without absolutely freezing them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my opinion, therefore, this, the only bird of American
game, which might well exist apart from almost all protection,
is now so protected as to be almost rendered impossible
to the gun of the fair sportsman; while for others,
the tamest, the most easily killed, and the most rapidly
decreasing of all our winged tribes, as the Woodcock, for
example, the mock protection afforded to them is but another
word for the license to slaughter them half-fledged
and half-grown, while the second brood is yet in the black-down,
and unable to exist without the parent’s care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would myself desire to see the legitimate season for
Ruffed Grouse-shooting made to commence with the first
day of September, the young birds by that time, and in
truth much earlier, being quite fit for the gun, and to cease
on the fifteenth of December, or at Christmas at the latest,
before the snows of winter admit of their being snared and
trapped by thousands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the middle of October, the old hens drive off
the broods, or the young birds now perfectly mature, stray
from them of their own accord; and thenceforth they are
found sometimes in little companies of two, three, or four,
but far more often singly, in wild, difficult upland woods,
through which they love to ramble deviously for miles, as
they are led in search of their favorite food, or sometimes,
as it would seem, by mere whim. On one occasion, many
years since, when I was but a young sportsman on this
side the Atlantic, I remember footing a small party of
five birds, in a light snow, for above ten miles among the
Wawayanda mountains, in Orange County, New York,
without getting up to them; although it was easily seen
by their hurried and agitated tracks that for a great part
of the distance, they were within hearing of me, and were
running from my pursuit. I had no dogs with me. Had
I been out with setters, the Grouse would have trailed
them for miles, and unquestionably risen at last out of shot.
With spaniels, or curs, trained to run in upon them, and
pursue, yelping loudly, as the mode is in the backwoods
where men do not shoot but gun, they would have taken
to the trees, and would have sat close to the trunk with
their bodies erect, and their necks elongated, and might
have been killed easily, the only difficulty being that of
perceiving them, a difficulty far more considerable than
would be imagined to an unpracticed eye. To shoot birds
sitting, however, whether on trees or on the ground, is
not sport for a sportsman; the only case where it is ever
<span class='it'>allowable</span>, is to the woodsman on a tramp through the
primitive and boundless forest, where his camp-kettle
must be filled by the contents of his bag, and where to
throw away a chance is, perhaps, in the end to go supperless
to bed. In such a case, while canoeing it last Autumn
“with a goodly companye” up the northern rivers that
debouche into Lake Huron, we shot many, while portaging
around cataracts or rapids on the Severn; and on
one occasion a gentlemen of the party shot three birds,
out of one small pine-tree, without any of them moving or
appearing alarmed at the gun-shots. This has often been
related as a constant and ordinary habit of the bird; and
from that occurrence, I am induced to believe that when
the bird is in its natural solitudes, unacquainted with man
and his murderous weapons, such may be the case; in
the settlements, however, it might have been when they
were rare and sparse, this is the habit of the Ruffed Grouse
no longer. I have never in my life, save in the
instance mentioned, observed any thing of the kind; on
the contrary, I have ever found them the wildest, the
most wary, and, unless by some mere chance, the least
approachable of all wild birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the latter autumn, they eschew flat, bushy
tracts, and even swamps with heavy thicket, their instinct
probably telling them that in such covert they
are liable to be taken napping. If, however, one have the
fortune to find them in such tracts, he is likely to have
sport over setters; and in no other sort of ground do I
deem that possible, as the law now stands. Once, many
years since, sporting in the heavy thorn-brakes around
Pine Brook, in New Jersey, I found them with a friend in
low underwood, and we had great sport, bagging eight
brace of Ruffed Grouse over points, in addition to some
eighteen or twenty brace of Quail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general, however, they frequent either open groves
of tall, thrifty timber, with a carpet of wintergreens,
cranberries and whortleberries, which constitute their
favorite food; or the steep mountain-ledges, under the
interlaced branches of tall evergreen trees, among brakes
of mountain rhododendron, or, as it is commonly called,
though erroneously, laurel. In both these species of
ground, all being clear below, the birds can hear and see
the sportsman long before he can approach them, and
take wing, for the most part, entirely out of gun-shot
range. If, however, they are surprised unawares, they
have a singular tact of dodging behind the first bush, or
massive trunk, and flying off in a right line, keeping the obstacle
directly between the sportsman and themselves, so
as to frustrate all his efforts to obtain a shot; this I have
seen done so often as to satisfy me that it is the result, not
of chance, but of a deliberate instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ruffed Grouse rises, at first, when surprised, with
a heavy whirring and laborious flutter, and if taken at that
moment within range, is easily shot; he rises for the most
part a little higher than the head of a tall man, and goes
away swift and strong nearly in a horizontal line. If
struck behind, he will carry away a heavy load of shot,
and he has a trick of flying until his breath leaves him in
the air, and then falls dead before he strikes the ground.
Occasionally he towers up with the wind, and then setting
his wings, skates down before it at a prodigious rate,
without moving a feather; and if you get a shot at him,
gentle reader, under such circumstances, crossing you at
long range, be sure that you shoot two, or by ’r lady three
feet ahead of him, or you may cut off his extreme tail-feathers,
but of a surety kill him you shall not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ruffed Grouse usually flies in a perfectly right line,
so that if you flush one without getting a shot, and can
preserve his line exactly, you may find him, if he have not
treed, which it is ten to one he has; wherefore I advise
you not to follow him. The exception to this right line
of flight, is when the ground is broken into ridges with
parallel ravines, in which case the bird, on crossing a
ridge at right angles, will rarely cross the ravine also, but
will dive up or down, as the covert may invite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When birds lie in narrow ravines, filled with good
covert, by throwing the guns forward on the brow of the
ridges a hundred yards ahead of the dogs, which must be
left behind with a person to hunt and restrain them, and
letting the sportsmen carefully keep that distance in advance,
going very gingerly and silently, sport may be had;
and so I think only—especially over slow, mute, cocking
spaniels, for as the birds, after running before the dogs,
will be likely to take wing abreast of, or perhaps even behind
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
the unexpected shooter, who has thus stolen a march
on them, and as they rarely, if ever, cross the ridges, but
fly straight along the gorge, they so afford fair shots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my own part, I do not consider it worth the while,
as the law now stands, to go out in pursuit of Ruffed
Grouse with dogs, where you expect to find no other
species of game; for, in the first place, they ramble so
widely, that there is no certainty of finding them within
ten miles of the spot where you may have seen them daily
for a month; and, secondly, if you do find them, there is
no certainty of having sport with them, but rather a probability
of reverse. As an adjunct to other kinds of shooting
they are excellent, but as sole objects of pursuit, I
think, worthless. I have often blundered on them by
chance while hunting for other game; but when I have
gone out expressly in pursuit of them, I have never had
even tolerable sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the law were altered, and September shooting permitted,
the case would be altered also; and in many regions
of our country, as the Kaatskill Mountains, and
some parts of Columbia and Saratoga counties, in New
York; the Pocono Mountains, and the Blue Ridge, generally,
in Pennsylvania; and many districts of Maine,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, rare sport
might be had. For September shooting, No. 8 shot will be
found sufficient; but after that, No. 7; and very late in
the season, Eley’s wire cartridges will be found the most
effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This widely extended bird is too well known to require
any peculiar description; and I shall content myself with
observing, in aid of my portraiture of the Ruffed Grouse,
that the upper part of its head and hind neck are reddish-brown,
the back rich chestnut, mottled with heart-shaped
spots of white, edged with black. The tail is bright reddish-yellow,
barred and speckled with black, and bordered
by a broad, black belt between two narrow white bands,
one at the extremity of the tail. The iris of the eye hazel,
bill brown, feet brownish gray. Loral band cream color.
Throat and fore neck, brownish-yellow. Upper ruff-feathers
barred with brown. Wings brownish-red,
streaked with black. Breast and abdomen cream colored,
closely barred above, and laterally spotted below, with
dark chocolate. Length 18 inches, spread of wings 2 feet.
The Ruffed Grouse is a capital bird on the table. The
breast white meat, back and thighs brown. It should be
roasted quickly, eaten with bread sauce and fried crumbs,
and washed down with sherry or red wine.</p>

before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Yale College,
Aug 14, 1850. By Oliver Wendall Holmes. Boston:
Ticknor, Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Few college poems have attained, at the period of their
delivery, so fluttering a fame as did this last product of Dr.
Holmes’s forgetive and flashing brain; and it is now published
“by request of the Society,” and demand of the
public. Though it has not the geniality of “Urania,” nor its
sustained sweetness and subtility of sentiment, it is the
greatest of the author’s long poems in decision and depth
both of feeling and satire, and exhibits, perhaps, more
than his usual command of the powers and delicacies of
expression. The verse is a study for all heroic rhymers,
being fully equal to all the purposes of wit, fancy, imagination
and passion, and combining the utmost finish in
separate lines with a bounding movement in the whole.
The poem is a succession of beautiful pictures, grave and
mirthful, each of which symbolizes some powerful thought
or tender feeling, and some of which are hardly matched
in our poetry for brilliancy of effect. The satire is less
frolicksome than usual; here and there, indeed, its sting
draws blood; and the whole poem is conceived and executed
in a sterner and more earnest spirit than is common
with Dr. Holmes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opening paragraphs contain a most beautiful and
delicate tribute to the author’s father, who was educated
at Yale. The following lines refer, we suppose, to Dr.
Stiles, the president of the college at the time the elder
Holmes was a student, and contain an exquisite picture of
the filial relations of master and pupil:</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one can read this poem without wishing, with more
earnestness than the wish originally came from the throat
of Macbeth, that the author would throw “physic to the
dogs,” and devote himself exclusively to literature. He
is now but an “occasional” poet, though every piece he
produces evidences that his mind is a Fortunatus’ purse,
from which an endless succession of treasures might be
drawn, with little effort on his own part, but with
great delight to the public and great profit to his own
reputation. His wit, whether expressed in prose or
verse, is ever the pointed expression of sound sense,
of accurate observation, of searching, subtle thought,
and has, therefore, a permanent flavor, sharp and
sweet, which improves rather than deteriorates with
familiar acquaintance. Every thing he writes, whether
he reasons, observes, or creates, is distinguished pre-eminently
by vigor—a vigor which goes directly to its
object, and always succeeds in mastering and expressing
it. We wish he would not only write more poems, but
that he would invade the domain of romance, and bring us
back a novel. It would certainly be as original as any
ever produced by an American, and would exhibit to great
advantage his peculiar vein of sentiment—a vein as peculiar
as that of Tennyson, and capable of being embodied
in character with more perfection than he has yet succeeded
in expressing it in couplets.</p>

Africa. By R. Gordon Cumming. New York: Harper
&amp; Brothers. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A rare sportsman is Gordon Cumming—none of your
followers of snipe and grouse, of fox or stag, but a Cæsar
or Napoleon among hunters, a shooter of the giraffe and
the rhinoceros, the lion and the elephant, and a great many
other wild beasts, which your “even Christian” trembles
to behold in their tamed and caged menagerie representatives.
Seriously, this book is the most exciting production
of the kind we have ever read, and though full of
marvels, detailed in a style a little Mendez-Pintoish, is
probably substantially true. The author is a kinsman of
the Duke of Argyle, (to whom the volumes are dedicated,)
is an English officer, and a “Person of Honor;” his statements,
we suppose, must be taken as facts, as nobility,
like figures, cannot lie, and as the author’s gentle blood
did not come to him in a line of descent from William
Longbow. Whether, however, Gordon Cumming has
drawn a great deal from his imagination or not, his book
is an interesting one, and proclaims him a cool, daring,
invincible hunter—the greatest since Nimrod. Take
away from him a hundred of the elephants he swears he
shot, and he will have left enough to make a great reputation.
In addition to the hunting scenes, the volumes
contain no little information respecting the Hottentots and
Bushmen, and some splendid descriptions of African
scenery.</p>

The chapter on the Discovery of the Planet Neptune, is

The portions on the Recent Additions to our knowledge
of Comets, Fixed Stars and Nebulæ, convey a great deal
of information in a rigorously systematized form. There
are a hundred pages devoted to the progress of Astronomy
in the United States, which will be read with much interest,
as they enable us to understand the grounds of a
remark of the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, that
“the Americans, although late in the field of astronomical
enterprise, have now taken up that science with their
characteristic energy, and have already shown their
ability to instruct their former masters.”</p>

narrative, his style, without parting with any of its grace,
has an increased energy and rapidity of movement. He

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Catskill Mountain House.</span>—The beautiful picture of
Catskill Mountain House, and the surrounding scenery,
which we give our readers in this number, was painted
for the present publisher, in 1846, when we were, or
thought we were, richer than we are now. A party of
friends were with us on a visit to that delightful spot, in
that summer; and among the guests at the house was
the painter, Harvey, who, in his studious observation of
nature, was filling up a week or two prior to his departure
for Europe. Several pictures he had finished, of bits of
scenery and nooks about the mountain, all of them marked
by that wonderful fidelity to nature in her minute developments—each
blade, and each shade of each blade of
grass, and leaf elaborated with that patient skill, which
distinguishes his pictures. The morning we left, we
ordered the picture before the reader; and Smillie has just
engraved it in his matchless style. To our own eye, it is
one of the sweetest landscapes that we have ever placed
before the readers of “Graham;” and we now apprise our
friends that it is the first of a series of American views
which that artist is now executing for this Magazine.</p>

<hr class='tbk141'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DESCRIPTION OF FASHION PLATE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Walking Dresses</span>—<span class='it'>First Figure</span>.—Bonnet of pink taffeta,
covered with puffings and plaits of clear white organdy;
the right and the left side of the front are trimmed
with three little feathers, fastened in lightly and gracefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dress and <span class='it'>pardessus</span> of taffeta, of any color or shade,
according to fancy. The dress body is open before, and
high in the neck behind. The sleeves are large, of the
<span class='it'>pagoda</span> style, wider at the lower part than at the top or
arm-hole. The body is pointed before and behind. To
give style to these bodies, a little strap of tape is fastened
to the lower part of the waist, and this strap is attached
to the lower part of the back of the corset, in order to
make the back of the dress set well, and keep it from
puckering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skirt is very full, and very long, training a little
behind; it is trimmed with seven flounces, each flounce
six <span class='it'>centimêtres</span><a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> wide; and these flounces are placed about
five <span class='it'>centimêtres</span> apart; the highest flounce is about twenty-five
<span class='it'>centimêtres</span> from the waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>pardessus</span> is sufficiently sloped at the seams to
make it fit easily; it is a little pointed in front, and round
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scallops of the flounces are first traced with close
runnings of sewing silk, then embroidered in heavy button
hole stitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stomacher is of <span class='it'>tulle</span>: it opens square before, and
is trimmed with a <span class='it'>tulle</span> quilling, standing up around the
neck, with insertion at the lower part of the quilling; the
front is composed of five puffings, with insertion between
the puffings. The sleeve has one large puffing, with a
tight waistband and two ruffles.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Second Figure.</span>—Bonnet of black lace, bordered on the
edge with a <span class='it'>ruche</span> of the same, which <span class='it'>ruche</span> continues all
around the bonnet. This bonnet is trimmed with branches
of roses. Mantilla, or little scarf shawl, is of light green
taffeta, trimmed with broad silk lace, and embroidered in
a rich design with narrow silk braid. This embroidery is
worked in black on all light colors, or in a color a little
deeper than the shade of the taffeta. Stomacher is made
of lace, with insertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Little Girl.</span>—Dress of jaconet muslin, embroidered <span class='it'>à</span>
<span class='it'>l’Anglaise</span>. Mittens and stockings of open work silk.
Sash <span class='it'>à la president</span> around the waist, of taffeta ribbon of
the width No. 60. Silk boots and straw hat, with a crown
of roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Edgar A. Poe.</span>—By the decision of several discreet
friends of the lamented Poe, we omit a number of letters
and articles, which have been collected in relation to his
life and writings. The wounds made by his criticisms
are too fresh—the conflicting interests too many, to hope
now to do that justice which time and the sober second
thought of educated minds will accord to his memory.
In the March number, we gave a short sketch of the poet,
and hereafter the grateful duty may be more amply fulfilled—without
making this Magazine, seemingly, the
medium through which to gratify personal hostilities.</p>

<hr class='tbk143'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS EDITORIAL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Fellow-Laborers</span>:—We address you at the close of
the year 1850, with an involuntary wish struggling upward
from the heart, for a happy New Year—a glorious
baptism of good for 1851. We do this, too, with some
misgivings lest we may presume upon your forbearance—but
the cordial response you have given to our monthly
labors—the encouraging and timely words spoken in our
behalf at the outset of the somewhat perilous enterprise
of carrying our shattered bark into harbor once more—with
all its sails stripped and cordage gone, came over
the dark waters cheeringly, stimulating our weak endeavors,
and nerving our heart for the tempest or the calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With no money—a few friends, and a thousand discouragements
thrust upon us by timid well-wishers—and
half-hearted comforters—we undertook to carry Graham’s
Magazine—with its harvest of money, received in December,
January and February, the pick months of the
year, scattered—we undertook, we say, to carry this
book triumphantly—in the face of the fiercest competition
the business has ever known—through the year 1850.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American Press with a chivalry for a prostrate
brother, such as has never been witnessed—with one accord,
from the extreme North to the extreme South, raised
its voice of encouragement—its cheer for our success—and
we now close the volume with an addition of over
10,000 subscribers since July, and with the uttermost
liberality in expenditure in the manufacture of Graham’s
Magazine, <span class='it'>met</span> by the tremendous resources which <span class='it'>you</span>,
gentlemen, by the power of advertising, in liberal notices,
have showered upon us. From our heart we thank you!
Our experience in the press, daily, weekly, and monthly,
for twelve years, has taught us how little the press itself
knows of its own power—how few out of it know its giant
resources—the wealth it carries on its wings to those who
use it wisely. Judge, then, whether we, who have partaken
so largely of its benefits from your generosity alone,
knowing fully the vast service your kindness has done us,
can do less than convey to you our sense of the obligation,
with a hope that the day is dawning which will enable us
to <span class='it'>attempt</span> in some poor sort to repay you. We say
<span class='it'>attempt</span> to repay, for the reactionary benefit will be ten-fold
upon ourself—so that we must by inevitable laws,
remain forever your debtor.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
